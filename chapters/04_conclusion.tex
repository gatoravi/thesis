My thesis consists of two main parts. 
In the first part I investigated cell-to-cell variability in the hedgehog pathway... We showed
In the second chapter we integrated the same reporter gene and looked at how the cell to cell variability changes across 
different integrations across the genome. .. We did.. we showed.. 

no stochastic activation of hedgehog pathway in 3T3 cells

Prrx1 can induce a faster response. how does it do it. how many other regulators are there.

\subsection{what do these results mean}


\subsection{what can we do by controlling noise}
- gene therapy

\subsection{Future Directions}
hedgehog:
molecular barcoding instead of trajectory analysis
increase accessible cholesterol instead of srebf2
How can we identify other TFs that drive noise?



cas:
scaling up to more number of cells using scirnaseq
