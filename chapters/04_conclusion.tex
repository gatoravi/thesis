My thesis consists of two main parts. In the first part I investigated cell-to-cell variability in the hedgehog pathway. In the second chapter 


no stochastic activation of hedgehog pathway in 3T3 cells
Prrx1 can induce a faster response. how does it do it. how many other regulators are there.

In the second part we integrated the same reporter gene and looked at how the cell to cell variability changes across 
different integrations across the genome.

\subsection{what do these results mean}



\subsection{Future Directions}
hedgehog:
molecular barcoding instead of trajectory analysis
increase accessible cholesterol instead of srebf2



cas:
scaling up to more number of cells using scirnaseq
