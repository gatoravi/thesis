\thesisacknowledgments

Firstly, I would like to thank my thesis mentor Barak Cohen. I was in a tough spot when I joined Barak's lab and I'm extremely thankful that he gave me an opportunity to train in his lab. Barak's mentoring is something I will really miss to say the least. He put my development at the forefront of my PhD, and was able to help me identify my strengths and weaknesses right at the start of my PhD (starting at the rotation.) He encouraged us to attend seminars, department events and always set an example by doing things himself. The work in Chapter 3 just started as a conversation amongst us graduate students and Barak was willing to support our ideas from the beginning with maximum freedom.
