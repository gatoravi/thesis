Firstly, I would like to thank my thesis mentor Barak Cohen. I was in a tough position when I joined Barak's lab, a sinking ship I think Barak called it, and I'm extremely thankful that he gave me an opportunity to join and train in his lab. Barak's mentoring is something I will really miss to say the very least. He put my development at the forefront of my PhD, and was able to help me identify my strengths and weaknesses right at the start of my PhD (starting at the rotation.) He encouraged all of us to attend seminars, department events and always set an example by doing things himself. The work in Chapter 3 just started as a conversation amongst us graduate students and Barak was willing to support our ideas from the beginning with the maximum freedom imaginable. 

I would like to thank my wife Alicia for her constant fun presence and thoughtfulness since before and throughout graduate school. We got married and welcomed Arjun during graduate school. There were innumerable occasions of me complaining to her about something that didn't work. Thank you for being there, I couldn't have finished this thesis without you. Thanks also for introducing me to your amazing parents and your family who were also vested in my success during this program.

I would like to thank my Mom for always checking on me during graduate school and for coming over to watch Arjun during the chaotic few months after his birth. I'd like to thank my sister for watching over my mom in India.

I would like to thank all my thesis commmittee members - Tim Schedl, Gary Stormo, Shankar Mukherji and Nate Stitziel. Everyone of them had an open door policy and I took it upon myself to learn from their expertise. I'd especially like to thank Tim. There were many occasions that I would just stop by Tim's office to chat about something interesting that I'd read or heard just to have a conversation and see what he thought about it. He was always welcoming and I just felt really fortunate that I could receive his mentorship throughout graduate school. The Precision Medicine Pathway that Tim organized offered me innumerable occasions to interact with and learn from top researchers from around the world. Thank you Tim.

I'd also like to thank all the HSG faculty, especially Nancy Saccone for answering all the questions related to statistical genetics and for helping work on a project related to Polygenic Risk Scores. I'd like to also thank Malachi Griffith and Obi Griffith for incredibly support and mentorship when I worked in their lab prior to my PhD. I'd like to also thank Don Conrad for sharing his insatiable passion for human genetics with me.

I would like to thank my lab mates for a fantastic intellectual atmosphere to do a PhD in and asking me the tough questions during lab meetings. I'll definitely miss our lab meeting environment. I'd like to especially acknowledge Siqi and Clarice, whom I worked closely with on the work described in Chapter 3. Attending both their weddings was one of the biggest highlights of my graduate school life. I'd also like to thank Dana King who was incredibly supportive when I first joined the lab. I always enjoyed chatting with Dustin Baldridge about human genetics research, and I'm incredibly  Also, thanks to everyone on the fourth floor of the Couch building for the many conversations over coffee/tea and lunch.

WashU has been an incredible place for me to pursue my PhD, and I am deeply grateful for this opportunity. I would like to acknowledge DBBS for a fantastic training environment for my PhD.  I'd especially like to acknowledge Sara Holmes for help behind the scenes, all my fellow DBBS students I worked with at the Student Advisory Committee (SAC). Doing a PhD took a toll on my physical and mental health at times, thanks to fantastic health resources available to DBBS PhD students at Student Health this was manageable. 

I would like to personally thank Abul Usmani whom I know from Don Conrad's lab, Xuhua Chen from Rob Mitra's lab for sharing their wet lab genius with me.Thanks to Jess, ML, Brian and Eric for enabling the CGS be a fantastic place to do genomics research.

I would like to thank my friends both in St. Louis and beyond - Harry, Jia, Ching, Kuan, Kalpit, Deepak. Thank you for directly or indirectly supporting me through this journey with your company.

Finally, thanks to Sky and Arjun for sharing your playtimes with me.
