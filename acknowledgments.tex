Firstly, I would like to thank my thesis mentor Barak Cohen. I was in a tough position when I joined Barak's lab and I'm extremely thankful that he gave me an opportunity to train in his lab. Barak's mentoring is something I will really miss to say the least. He put my development at the forefront of my PhD, and was able to help me identify my strengths and weaknesses right at the start of my PhD (starting at the rotation.) He encouraged us to attend seminars, department events and always set an example by doing things himself. The work in Chapter 3 just started as a conversation amongst us graduate students and Barak was willing to support our ideas from the beginning with maximum freedom. 

I would like to thank my wife Alicia for her constant support throughout graduate school. We got married and welcomed Arjun during graduate school. There were innumerable occasions of me complaining to her about something that didn't work. Thank you for being there, I couldn't have finished this thesis without you.

I would like to thank my Mom for always checking on me during graduate school, and for coming over to watch Arjun during the chaotic few months after his birth. I'd like to thank my sister for watching over my mom in India.

I would like to thank all my thesis commmittee members - Tim Schedl, Gary Stormo, Shankar Mukherji and Nate Stitziel. Everyone of them had an open door policy and I took it upon myself to learn from their expertise. I'd especially like to thank Tim. There were so many occasions that I would just stop by Tim's office to chat about something interesting that I'd read or heard and see what he thought about it. He was always welcoming and I just felt really fortunate that I could share some of his company and receive his mentorship throughout graduate school. Thank you Tim.

I'd also like to thank all the HSG faculty, especially Nancy Saccone for answering all the questions related to statistical genetics and for helping work on a project related to Polygenic Risk Scores. I'd like to also thank Malachi Griffith and Obi Griffith for incredibly support and mentorship when I worked in their lab prior to my PhD. I'd like to also thank Don Conrad for sharing his incredible passion for human genetics with me.

I would like to thank my lab mates for a fantastic intellectual atmosphere to do a PhD in and asking me the tough questions during lab meetings. I'll definitely miss our lab meeting environment. I'd like to especially acknowledge Siqi and Clarice, whom I worked closely with on the work described in Chapter 3. Attending both their weddings was one of the biggest highlights of my graduate school life. I'd also like to thank Dana King who was incredibly supportive when I first joined the lab. Also, thanks to everyone on the fourth floor of the Couch building for the many conversations over coffee/tea and lunch.

I would like to acknowledge DBBS for a fantastic training environment for my PhD. I again feel incredibly priveledged to be a part of DBBS. I'd especially like to acknowledge Sara Holmes for help behind the scenes, all my fellow DBBS students I worked with at the Student Advisory Committee (SAC). Doing a PhD took a toll on my physical and mental health at times, thanks to fantastic health resources at Student Health this was manageable. 

I would like to personally thank Abul Usmani whom I know from Don Conrad's lab, Xuhua Chen from Rob Mitra's lab for sharing their wet lab genius with me.Thanks also to Jess, ML, Brian and Eric for making the CGS a fantastic place to do genomics research.

I would like to thank my friends both in STL and beyond - Harry, Jia, Ching, Kuan, Kalpit, Deepak. Thank you for directly or indirectly supporting me through this journey with your company.

Finally, thanks to Sky and Arjun for sharing your playtime with me
