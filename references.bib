	abstract = {Postzygotic mutations (PZMs) begin to accrue in the human genome immediately after fertilization, but how and when PZMs affect development and lifetime health remains unclear. To study the origins and functional consequences of PZMs, we generated a multi-tissue atlas of PZMs from 948 donors using the final major release of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Nearly half the variation in mutation burden among tissue samples can be explained by measured technical and biological effects, while 9\% can be attributed to donor-specific effects. Through phylogenetic reconstruction of PZMs, we find that their type and predicted functional impact varies during prenatal development, across tissues, and the germ cell lifecycle. Remarkably, a class of prenatal mutations was predicted to be more deleterious than any other category of genetic variation investigated and under positive selection as strong as somatic mutations in cancers. In total, the data indicate that PZMs can contribute to phenotypic variation throughout the human lifespan, and, to better understand the relationship between genotype and phenotype, we must broaden the long-held assumption of one genome per individual to multiple, dynamic genomes per individual.

	abstract = {Stochastic differences among clonal cells can initiate cell fate decisions in development or cause cell-to-cell differences in the responses to drugs or extracellular ligands. We hypothesize that some of this phenotypic variability is caused by stochastic fluctuations in the activities of transcription factors. We tested this hypothesis in NIH3T3-CG cells using the response to Hedgehog signaling as a model cellular response. Here we present evidence for the existence of distinct fast and slow responding substates of NIH3T3-CG cells. These two substates have distinct expression profiles, and fluctuations in the activity of the Prrx1 transcription factor (TF) underlie some of the differences in expression and responsiveness between fast and slow cells. We speculate that similar variability in other TFs may underlie other phenotypic differences among genetically identical cells.},

This heterogeneity seems to arise from fluctuations of Nanog expression in individual cells, but a thorough characterization of these fluctuations and their impact on the pluripotent state is still lacking. Here, we have used a novel fluorescent reporter to investigate the temporal dynamics of NANOG expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), and to dissect the lineage potential of mESCs at different NANOG states. Our results show that stochastic NANOG fluctuations are widespread in mESCs, with essentially all expressing cells showing fluctuations in NANOG levels, even when cultured in ground-state conditions (2i media). We further show that fluctuations have similar kinetics when mESCs are cultured in standard conditions (serum plus leukemia inhibitory factor) or ground-state conditions, implying that NANOG fluctuations are inherent to the pluripotent state. We have then compared the developmental potential of low-NANOG and high-NANOG mESCs, grown in different conditions, and confirm that mESCs are more susceptible to enter differentiation at the low-NANOG state. Further analysis by gene expression profiling reveals that low-NANOG cells have marked expression of lineage-affiliated genes, with variable profiles according to the signalling environment. By contrast, high-NANOG cells show a more stable expression profile in different environments, with minimal expression of lineage markers. Altogether, our data support a model in which stochastic NANOG fluctuations provide opportunities for mESCs to explore multiple lineage options, modulating their probability to change functional state.},

  abstract = {The development of cancer is intimately associated with genetic abnormalities that target proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). In human haematological malignancies, recurrent chromosomal translocation of nucleoporin (NUP98 or NUP214) generates an aberrant chimera that invariably retains the nucleoporin IDR\textemdash tandemly dispersed repeats of phenylalanine and glycine residues1,2. However, how unstructured IDRs contribute to oncogenesis remains unclear. Here we show that IDRs contained within NUP98\textendash HOXA9, a homeodomain-containing transcription factor chimera recurrently detected in leukaemias1,2, are essential for establishing liquid\textendash liquid phase separation (LLPS) puncta of chimera and for inducing leukaemic transformation. Notably, LLPS of NUP98\textendash HOXA9 not only promotes chromatin occupancy of chimera transcription factors, but also is required for the formation of a broad `super-enhancer'-like binding pattern typically seen at leukaemogenic genes, which potentiates transcriptional activation. An artificial HOX chimera, created by replacing the phenylalanine and glycine repeats of NUP98 with an unrelated LLPS-forming IDR of the FUS protein3,4, had similar enhancing effects on the genome-wide binding and target gene activation of the chimera. Deeply sequenced Hi-C revealed that phase-separated NUP98\textendash HOXA9 induces CTCF-independent chromatin loops that are enriched at proto-oncogenes. Together, this report describes a proof-of-principle example in which cancer acquires mutation to establish oncogenic transcription factor condensates via phase separation, which simultaneously enhances their genomic targeting and induces organization of aberrant three-dimensional chromatin structure during tumourous transformation. As LLPS-competent molecules are frequently implicated in diseases1,2,4\textendash 7, this mechanism can potentially be generalized to many malignant and pathological settings.},

The phytohormone auxin influences the position of this niche by an unknown mechanism. Here, we identify the PLETHORA1 (PLT1) and PLT2 genes encoding AP2 class putative transcription factors, which are essential for QC specification and stem cell activity. The PLT genes are transcribed in response to auxin accumulation and are dependent on auxin response transcription factors. Distal PLT transcript accumulation creates an overlap with the radial expression domains of SHORT-ROOT and SCARECROW, providing positional information for the stem cell niche. Furthermore, the PLT genes are activated in the basal embryo region that gives rise to hypocotyl, root, and root stem cells and, when ectopically expressed, transform apical regions to these identities. Thus, the PLT genes are key effectors for establishment of the stem cell niche during embryonic pattern formation.},

  abstract = {Genome sequencing has revealed that in metazoans, only a small percentage of DNA actually codes for functional proteins. Research efforts have focused on elucidating the purpose of the rest of the genome, which was initially largely thought of as mere 'junk' DNA. One genomic region that is proving to be a rich source of new information is the Drosophila bithorax complex (BX-C). At this homeotic gene complex, many different classes of cis-regulatory elements, such as insulators, silencers, enhancers, and promoters, work together to tightly control gene expression during development. Recent studies have begun to unravel the intricate nature of these regulatory interactions. The BX-C was first discovered and characterized by Ed Lewis over three decades ago. In his seminal 1978 Nature paper, Lewis speculated that "substances" originating from the nongenic regions of the BX-C may regulate expression of the neighboring abdominal-A and Abdominal-B homeotic genes. A number of discoveries in the last few years suggest that he was right. The activation of some of the cis-sequences at the complex appears to be controlled by nongenic transcription, providing a further level of regulatory complexity to regions of nonprotein coding DNA. The hope is that these studies of gene regulation at the BX-C in the humble fruit fly will provide clues as to how vast intergenic regions contribute to the incredible complexity of gene regulation in other species, including humans.},

To understand the interplay between spatial genome organization and specific mutational processes, we studied 3,000 tumor\textendash normal-pair whole-genome datasets from 42 different human cancer types. Our analyses reveal that the change in somatic mutational load in cancer genomes is co-localized with topologically-associating-domain boundaries. Domain boundaries constitute a better proxy to track mutational load change than replication timing measurements. We show that different mutational processes lead to distinct somatic mutation distributions where certain processes generate mutations in active domains, and others generate mutations in inactive domains. Overall, the interplay between three-dimensional genome organization and active mutational processes has a substantial influence on the large-scale mutation-rate variations observed in human cancers.},

We find that Sox2 and SCR show no evidence of enhanced spatial proximity and that spatial dynamics of this pair is limited over tens of minutes. Sox2 transcription occurs in short, intermittent bursts in ESCs and, intriguingly, we find this activity demonstrates no association with enhancer proximity, suggesting that direct enhancer-promoter contacts do not drive contemporaneous Sox2 transcription. Our study establishes a framework for interrogation of enhancer function in living cells and supports an unexpected mechanism for enhancer control of Sox2 expression that uncouples transcription from enhancer proximity.},

Here we show that genetic ablation of a lncRNA locus on human chromosome 2 causes a severe congenital limb malformation. We identified homozygous 27\textendash 63-kilobase deletions located 300~kilobases upstream of the engrailed-1 gene (EN1) in patients with a complex limb malformation featuring mesomelic shortening, syndactyly and ventral nails (dorsal dimelia). Re-engineering of the human deletions in mice resulted in a complete loss of En1 expression in the limb and a double dorsal-limb phenotype that recapitulates the human disease phenotype. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis in the developing mouse limb revealed a four-exon-long non-coding transcript within the deleted region, which we named Maenli. Functional dissection of the Maenli locus showed that its transcriptional activity is required for limb-specific En1 activation in cis, thereby fine-tuning the gene-regulatory networks controlling dorso-ventral polarity in the developing limb bud. Its loss results in the En1-related dorsal ventral limb phenotype, a subset of the full En1-associated phenotype. Our findings demonstrate that mutations involving lncRNA loci can result in human Mendelian disease.},

Expansion microscopy has allowed for better visualization of small structures by expanding the tissues with a polymer- and hydrogel-based system. Alon et al. combined expansion microscopy with long-read in situ RNA sequencing, resulting in a more precise visualization of the location of specific transcripts. This method, termed ``ExSeq'' for expansion sequencing, was used to detect RNAs, both new transcripts and those previously demonstrated to localize to neuronal dendrites.

Science, this issue p. eaax2656 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONCells and tissues are made up of diverse molecular building blocks, organized with nanoscale precision over extended length scales. Newly developed techniques that enable highly multiplexed, nanoscale, and subcellular analysis of such systems are required. Although much progress has been made on methods for multiplexed RNA imaging, these methods have been limited in their spatial precision, especially in the context of three-dimensional systems such as tissues. Because of this limitation, interrogation of tissues has been performed with either high spatial resolution or high molecular multiplexing capacity, but not both. RATIONALEWe reasoned that physically expanding specimens by adapting expansion microscopy could help support spatially precise in situ sequencing. The physical expansion of specimens provides two benefits: First, it enables ordinary microscopes to achieve nanoscale effective resolution. Second, by anchoring RNA molecules to a polymer network, digesting away other molecules, and then expanding the polymer in water, RNAs become more accessible. By creating a chemical process that enables enzymatic reactions to proceed in expanded specimens, we enabled in situ fluorescent sequencing of RNA with high spatial precision, which we term expansion sequencing (ExSeq). We developed both untargeted (i.e., not restricted to a predefined set of genes) and targeted versions of ExSeq. RESULTSUsing untargeted ExSeq, we showed the presence of transcripts that retain their introns, transcription factors, and long noncoding RNAs in mouse hippocampal neuron dendrites. Using targeted ExSeq, we observed layer-specific cell types across the mouse visual cortex and RNAs in nanoscale compartments of hippocampal pyramidal neurons, such as dendritic spines and branches. We found that spines could exhibit distributions of mRNAs different from those exhibited by adjacent dendrites. Moreover, we found patterns of similarity between the dendritic profiles of RNAs in different types of hippocampal neurons. In a human metastatic breast cancer biopsy, we mapped how cell types expressed genes differently as a function of their distance from other cell types, identifying, for example, cellular states of immune cells specific to when they were close to tumor cells. CONCLUSIONExSeq enables highly multiplexed mapping of RNAs\textemdash from nanoscale to system scale\textemdash in intact cells and tissues. We explore how RNAs are preferentially targeted to dendrites and spines of neurons, suggesting RNA localization principles that may generalize across different cell types. We also examine gene expression differences in cell types as a function of their distance from other cell types in the context of a human cancer, which may yield insights into future therapeutic approaches that take cellular interactions into account. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/371/6528/eaax2656/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint In situ sequencing of physically expanded specimens enables multiplexed mapping of RNAs at nanoscale, subcellular resolution throughout intact tissues.(Top) Schematics of physical expansion and in situ sequencing (left) and image analysis (right). (Bottom) Characterization of nanoscale transcriptomic compartmentalization in mouse hippocampal neuron dendrites and spines (left and middle) and maps of cell types and states in a metastatic human breast cancer biopsy (right). Methods for highly multiplexed RNA imaging are limited in spatial resolution and thus in their ability to localize transcripts to nanoscale and subcellular compartments. We adapt expansion microscopy, which physically expands biological specimens, for long-read untargeted and targeted in situ RNA sequencing. We applied untargeted expansion sequencing (ExSeq) to the mouse brain, which yielded the readout of thousands of genes, including splice variants. Targeted ExSeq yielded nanoscale-resolution maps of RNAs throughout dendrites and spines in the neurons of the mouse hippocampus, revealing patterns across multiple cell types, layer-specific cell types across the mouse visual cortex, and the organization and position-dependent states of tumor and immune cells in a human metastatic breast cancer biopsy. Thus, ExSeq enables highly multiplexed mapping of RNAs from nanoscale to system scale. An adaptation of expansion microscopy allows in situ sequencing and multiplexed subcellular mapping of RNAs.

  abstract = {Malignant transformation of cells is typically associated with increased proliferation, loss of contact inhibition, acquisition of anchorage-independent growth potential, and the ability to form tumors in experimental animals(1). In NIH 3T3 cells, the Ras signal transduction pathway is known to trigger many of these events, what is known as Ras transformation. The introduction of an overexpressed gene in NIH 3T3 cells may promote morphological transformation and loss of contact inhibition, which can help determine the oncogenic potential of that gene of interest. An assay that provides a straightforward method to assess one aspect of the transforming potential of an oncogene is the Focus Formation Assay (FFA)(2). When NIH 3T3 cells divide normally in culture, they do so until they reach a confluent monolayer. However, in the presence of an overexpressed oncogene, these cells can begin to grow in dense, multilayered foci(1) that can be visualized and quantified by crystal violet or Hema 3 staining. In this article we describe the FFA protocol with retroviral transduction of the gene of interest into NIH 3T3 cells, and how to quantify the number of foci through staining. Retroviral transduction offers a more efficient method of gene delivery than transfection, and the use of an ecotropic murine retrovirus provides a biosafety control when working with potential human oncogenes.},

  abstract = {Nuclear architecture is decisive for the assembly of transcriptional responses. However, how chromosome organization is dynamically modulated to permit rapid and transient transcriptional changes in response to environmental challenges remains unclear. Here we show that hyperosmotic stress disrupts different levels of chromosome organization, ranging from A/B compartment changes to reduction in the number and insulation of topologically associating domains (TADs). Concomitantly, transcription is greatly affected, TAD borders weaken, and RNA Polymerase II runs off from hundreds of transcription end sites. Stress alters the binding profiles of architectural proteins, which explains the disappearance of local chromatin organization. These processes are dynamic, and cells rapidly reconstitute their default chromatin conformation after stress removal, uncovering an intrinsic organization. Transcription is not required for local chromatin reorganization, while compartment recovery is partially transcription-dependent. Thus, nuclear organization in mammalian cells can be rapidly modulated by environmental changes in a reversible manner.},

  abstract = {The three-dimensional organization of chromatin contributes to transcriptional control, but information about native chromatin distribution is limited. Imaging chromatin in live Drosophila larvae, with preserved nuclear volume, revealed that active and repressed chromatin separates from the nuclear interior and forms a peripheral layer underneath the nuclear lamina. This is in contrast to the current view that chromatin distributes throughout the nucleus. Furthermore, peripheral chromatin organization was observed in distinct Drosophila tissues, as well as in live human effector T lymphocytes and neutrophils. Lamin A/C up-regulation resulted in chromatin collapse toward the nuclear center and correlated with a significant reduction in the levels of active chromatin. Physical modeling suggests that binding of lamina-associated domains combined with chromatin self-attractive interactions recapitulate the experimental chromatin distribution profiles. Together, our findings reveal a novel mode of mesoscale organization of peripheral chromatin sensitive to lamina composition, which is evolutionary conserved. Live imaging of chromatin in an intact organism reveals a novel mode of mesoscale chromatin organization at nuclear periphery.

By multiplexing fluorescence in situ hybridization probes for these mutations, up to eight genetic abnormalities can be detected in single cells, a genetic signature of subclones identified and a composite picture of subclonal architecture and putative ancestral trees assembled. Subclones in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia have variegated genetics and complex, nonlinear or branching evolutionary histories. Copy number alterations are independently and reiteratively acquired in subclones of individual patients, and in no preferential order. Clonal architecture is dynamic and is subject to change in the lead-up to a diagnosis and in relapse. Leukaemia propagating cells, assayed by serial transplantation in NOD/SCID IL2R{$\gamma$}null mice, are also genetically variegated, mirroring subclonal patterns, and vary in competitive regenerative capacity in vivo. These data have implications for cancer genomics and for the targeted therapy of cancer.},

GP bundles are important for powering cell migration, yet have an unknown mechanism of formation. Electron microscopy and the fate of photobleached marks show actin filaments undergoing retrograde flow in filopodia, and the lamellipodium are structurally and dynamically linked with stationary GP bundles within the lamella. An individual filopodium initially protrudes, but then becomes separated from the tip of the lamellipodium and seeds the formation of a new GP bundle within the lamella. In individual live cells expressing both GFP-myosin II and RFP-actin, myosin II puncta localize to the base of an individual filopodium an average 28 s before the filopodium seeds the formation of a new GP bundle. Associated myosin II is stationary with respect to the substratum in new GP bundles. Inhibition of myosin II motor activity in live cells blocks appearance of new GP bundles in the lamella, without inhibition of cell protrusion in the same timescale. We conclude retrograde F-actin flow and myosin II activity within the leading cell edge delivers F-actin to the lamella to seed the formation of new GP bundles.},

We show that enhancers share properties with CpG-poor messenger RNA promoters but produce bidirectional, exosome-sensitive, relatively short unspliced RNAs, the generation of which is strongly related to enhancer activity. The atlas is used to compare regulatory programs between different cells at unprecedented depth, to identify disease-associated regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms, and to classify cell-type-specific and ubiquitous enhancers. We further explore the utility of enhancer redundancy, which explains gene expression strength rather than expression patterns.

  abstract = {We report a new and simple technique for photo-mediated temporal and spatial control of gene activation in zebrafish embryos as an alternative to the gene 'knockdown' approach using antisense, morpholino-modified oligonucleotides (morpholinos). The synthetic compound 6-bromo-4-diazomethyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (Bhc-diazo) forms a covalent bond with the phosphate moiety of the sugar-phosphate backbone of RNA, a process known as caging. The 6-bromo-7-hydroxycoumarin-4-ylmethyl (Bhc) group binds to approximately 30 sites on the phosphate moieties per 1 kb of RNA sequence. Bhc-caged mRNA undergoes photolysis (uncaging) when exposed to long-wave ultraviolet light (350 to 365 nm). We show that Bhc-caged green fluorescent protein (Gfp) mRNA has severely reduced translational activity in vitro, whereas illumination of Bhc-caged mRNA with ultraviolet light leads to partial recovery of translational activity. Bhc-caged mRNA is highly stable in zebrafish embryos. In embryos injected with Bhc-caged Gfp mRNA at the one-cell stage, GFP protein expression and fluorescence is specifically induced by ultraviolet light. We also show that, consistent with results obtained using other methods, uncaging eng2a (which encodes the transcription factor Engrailed2a) in the head region during early development causes a severe reduction in the size of the eye and enhanced development of the midbrain and the midbrain-hindbrain boundary at the expense of the forebrain.},

We also discuss the dynamics of chromatin interactions between enhancers and promoters, as well as the consequent changes in gene expression, that occur in pluripotent cells and during development. Finally, we evaluate how genomic changes such as deletions, inversions and duplications affect 3D chromatin configuration overall and lead to ectopic enhancer-promoter contacts, and thus gene misexpression, which can contribute to abnormal development and disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: More than 80\% of mammalian protein-coding genes are driven by TATA-less promoters which often show multiple transcriptional start sites (TSSs). However, little is known about the core promoter DNA sequences or mechanisms of transcriptional initiation for this class of promoters. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we identify a new core promoter element XCPE2 (X core promoter element 2) (consensus sequence: A/C/G-C-C/T-C-G/A-T-T-G/A-C-C/A(+1)-C/T) that can direct specific transcription from the second TSS of hepatitis B virus X gene mRNA. XCPE2 sequences can also be found in human promoter regions and typically appear to drive one of the start sites within multiple TSS-containing TATA-less promoters. To gain insight into mechanisms of transcriptional initiation from this class of promoters, we examined requirements of several general transcription factors by in vitro transcription experiments using immunodepleted nuclear extracts and purified factors. Our results show that XCPE2-driven transcription uses at least TFIIB, either TFIID or free TBP, RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) and the MED26-containing mediator complex but not Gcn5. Therefore, XCPE2-driven transcription can be carried out by a mechanism which differs from previously described TAF-dependent mechanisms for initiator (Inr)- or downstream promoter element (DPE)-containing promoters, the TBP- and SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase)-dependent mechanism for yeast TATA-containing promoters, or the TFTC (TBP-free-TAF-containing complex)-dependent mechanism for certain Inr-containing TATA-less promoters. EMSA assays using XCPE2 promoter and purified factors further suggest that XCPE2 promoter recognition requires a set of factors different from those for TATA box, Inr, or DPE promoter recognition. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We identified a new core promoter element XCPE2 that are found in multiple TSS-containing TATA-less promoters. Mechanisms of promoter recognition and transcriptional initiation for XCPE2-driven promoters appear different from previously shown mechanisms for classical promoters that show single "focused" TSSs. Our studies provide insight into novel mechanisms of RNA Pol II transcription from multiple TSS-containing TATA-less promoters.},

In addition, novel genes have been discovered that modulate myogenesis and the activity of myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins in positive or negative ways.

  abstract = {Genes are commonly abstracted into a coding sequence and cis-regulatory elements (CREs), such as promoter and terminator regions, and short sequence motifs within these regions. Modern cloning techniques allow easy assembly of synthetic genetic constructs from discrete cis-regulatory modules. However, it is unclear how much the contributions of CREs to gene expression depend on other CREs in the host gene. Using budding yeast, we probe the extent of composability, or independent effects, of distinct CREs. We confirm that the quantitative effect of a terminator on gene expression depends on both promoter and coding sequence. We then explore whether individual cis-regulatory motifs within terminator regions display similar context dependence, focusing on putative regulatory motifs inferred using transcriptome-wide datasets of mRNA decay. We construct a library of diverse reporter genes, consisting of different combinations of motifs within various terminator contexts, paired with different promoters, to test the extent of composability. Our results show that the effect of a motif on RNA abundance depends both on its host terminator, and also on the associated promoter sequence. Consequently, this emphasises the need for improved motif inference algorithms that include both local and global context effects, which in turn could aid researchers in the accurate use of diverse CREs for the engineering of synthetic genetic constructs.},

Tumor cells interact with two types of interconnected microenvironments: the metabolic cell autonomous microenvironment and the nonautonomous cellular-molecular microenvironment comprising interactions between tumor cells and the surrounding stroma. Hypoxia is a central player in cancer progression, affecting not only tumor cell autonomous functions, such as cell division and invasion, resistance to therapy and genetic instability, but also nonautonomous processes, such as angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis and inflammation, all contributing to metastasis. Closely related microenvironmental stressors affecting cancer progression include, in addition to hypoxia, elevated interstitial pressure and oxidative stress. Noninvasive imaging offers multiple means to monitor the tumor microenvironment and its consequences, and can thus assist in the understanding of the biological basis of hypoxia and microenvironmental stress in cancer progression, and in the development of strategies to monitor therapies targeted at stress-induced tumor progression.},

  abstract = {Recent studies on cultured neurons have demonstrated that microtubules are transported down the axon in the form of short polymers. The transport of these microtubules is bidirectional, intermittent, asynchronous, and occurs at the fast rate of known motors. The majority of the microtubule mass in the axon exists in the form of longer immobile microtubules. We have proposed a model called `cut and run', in which the longer microtubules are mobilized by enzymes that sever them into shorter mobile polymers. In this view, the molecular motors that transport microtubules are not selective for short microtubules but rather impinge upon microtubules irrespective of their length. In the case of the longer microtubules, these motor-driven forces do not transport the microtubules in a rapid and concerted fashion but presumably affect them nonetheless. Here, we discuss the mechanisms by which the short microtubules are transported and suggest possibilities for how analogous mechanisms may align and organize the longer microtubules and functionally integrate them with each other and with the actin cytoskeleton.},

Here, we present decoupleR, a Bioconductor and Python package containing computational methods to extract these activities within a unified framework. decoupleR allows us to flexibly run any method with a given resource, including methods that leverage mode of regulation and weights of interactions, which are not present in other frameworks.

Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is an important regulated step in gene expression frequently perturbed in human disease. To understand the combined effects of mutations during evolution, we quantified the effects of all possible combinations of exonic mutations accumulated during the emergence of an alternatively spliced human exon. This revealed that mutation effects scale non-monotonically with the inclusion level of an exon, with each mutation having maximum effect at a predictable intermediate inclusion level. This scaling is observed genome-wide for cis and trans perturbations of splicing, including for natural and disease-associated variants. Mathematical modeling suggests that competition between alternative splice sites is sufficient to cause this non-linearity in the genotype-phenotype map. Combining the global scaling law with specific pairwise interactions between neighboring mutations allows accurate prediction of the effects of complex genotype changes involving {$>$}10 mutations.},

Here, we identified the \emph{Drosophila} transcription factor Motif 1 Binding Protein (M1BP) in physical association with the \emph{gypsy} chromatin insulator core complex, including the universal insulator protein CP190. M1BP is required for enhancer-blocking and barrier activities of the \emph{gypsy} insulator as well as its proper nuclear localization. Genome-wide, M1BP specifically colocalizes with CP190 at Motif 1-containing promoters, which are enriched at topologically associating domain (TAD) borders. M1BP facilitates CP190 chromatin binding at many shared sites and vice versa. Both factors promote Motif 1-dependent gene expression and transcription near TAD borders genome-wide. Finally, loss of M1BP reduces chromatin accessibility and increases both inter- and intra-TAD local genome compaction. Our results reveal physical and functional interaction between CP190 and M1BP to activate transcription at TAD borders and mediate chromatin insulator-dependent genome organization.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Few factors securing chromatin interactions have so far been identified. Here, by integrating chromatin interaction maps with the large collection of transcription factor-binding profiles provided by the ENCODE project, we demonstrate that the zinc-finger protein ZNF143 preferentially occupies anchors of chromatin interactions connecting promoters with distal regulatory elements. It binds directly to promoters and associates with lineage-specific chromatin interactions and gene expression. Silencing ZNF143 or modulating its DNA-binding affinity using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as a surrogate of site-directed mutagenesis reveals the sequence dependency of chromatin interactions at gene promoters. We also find that chromatin interactions alone do not regulate gene expression. Together, our results identify ZNF143 as a novel chromatin-looping factor that contributes to the architectural foundation of the genome by providing sequence specificity at promoters connected with distal regulatory elements.},

RESULTS: The STREME algorithm presented here advances the state-of-the-art in ab initio motif discovery in terms of both accuracy and versatility. Using in vivo DNA (ChIP-seq) and RNA (CLIP-seq) data, and validating motifs with reference motifs derived from in vitro data, we show that STREME is more accurate, sensitive and thorough than several widely used algorithms (DREME, HOMER, MEME, Peak-motifs) and two other representative algorithms (ProSampler and Weeder). STREME's capabilities include the ability to find motifs in datasets with hundreds of thousands of sequences, to find both short and long motifs (from 3 to 30 positions), to perform differential motif discovery in pairs of sequence datasets, and to find motifs in sequences over virtually any alphabet (DNA, RNA, protein and user-defined alphabets). Unlike most motif discovery algorithms, STREME reports a useful estimate of the statistical significance of each motif it discovers. STREME is easy to use individually via its web server or via the command line, and is completely integrated with the widely-used MEME Suite of sequence analysis tools. The name STREME stands for "Simple, Thorough, Rapid, Enriched Motif Elicitation".

The lamella terminates in ruffling lamellipodia that face the direction of migration. Although the role of actin in the formation of lamellipodia is well established, it remains unclear to what degree microtubules contribute to this process. Herein, we have studied the contribution of microtubules to cell motility by time-lapse video microscopy on green flourescence protein-actin- and tubulin-green fluorescence protein-transfected melanoma cells. Treatment of cells with either the microtubule-disrupting agent nocodazole or with the stabilizing agent taxol showed decreased ruffling and lamellipodium formation. However, this was not due to an intrinsic inability to form ruffles and lamellipodia because both were restored by stimulation of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in a Rac-dependent manner, and by stem cell factor in melanoblasts expressing the receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit. Although ruffling and lamellipodia were formed without microtubules, the microtubular network was needed for advancement of the cell body and the subsequent retraction of the tail. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the formation of lamellipodia can occur via actin polymerization independently of microtubules, but that microtubules are required for cell migration, tail retraction, and modulation of cell adhesion.},

The concentration of F2,6BP depends on the activity of the bifunctional enzyme, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase). Four genes encoding PFK-2/FBPase have been identified and termed PFKFB1 to PFKFB4. PFKFB3 protein is expressed in high levels in human tumors in situ. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of functional interactions between the phosphorylation of PFKFB3 and activated glycolysis in human cancer cells. Experimental Design: cDNA from several human tumor cell lines and human colon carcinoma were analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR to identify different splicing variants of PFKFB3. The effect of phosphorylation of Ser461 was studied by recombinantly replacing this residue with glutamate (PFKFB3S461E). The phosphorylation of PFKFB3 protein in human cancer was determined by immunostaining using an anti-phospho-PFK-2(PFKFB3) antibody. Results: Two splicing variants of PFKFB3 are expressed in human cancer cell lines: PFKFB3-ACG and PFKFB3-AG. Quantitative, real-time PCR analysis confirmed the overexpression of PFKFB3 mRNA in colon carcinoma, with the dominant variant being the PFKFB3-ACG isoform that contains a phosphorylation site at Ser461. Forced expression of PFKFB3-ACG in COS-7 cells resulted in enhanced glycolysis. Introduction of PFKFB3-ACGS461E into COS-7 cells led to increased the lactate production and cell proliferation. Highly phosphorylated PFKFB3 protein was found in human tumor cells, vascular endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, as determined by immunostaining with an anti-phospho-PFK-2(PFKFB3) antibody. Conclusions: These findings support a potential role for the phosphorylation of PFKFB3 protein in the progression of cancer and angiogenesis.},

Transcripts were barely detectable when {$\beta$}-globin gene-plasmid recombinants were used. However, 200 times more {$\beta$}-globin gene transcripts were found when the {$\beta$}-globin gene recombinants also contained SV40 DNA, and 90\% of these transcripts (about 1000 per cell) had the same 5{${'}$} end as authentic rabbit globin mRNA. In the latter case, abundant production of {$\beta$}-globin protein was readily detected in a fraction of transfected cells by immunofluorescent staining. Enhancement of globin gene expression was dependent on SV40 sequences acting in cis, but independent of the viral origin of DNA replication. The enhancing activity was associated with the 72 bp repeated sequence element located at the beginning of the viral late gene region. Viral DNA fragments containing the transcriptional enhancer element could act in either orientation at many positions, including 1400 bp upstream or 3300 bp downstream from the transcription initiation site of the rabbit {$\beta$}-globin gene. These studies define a class of DNA elements with a mode of action that has not been heretofore described. The activation of genes by specific enhancer elements seems to be a widespread mechanism that may be used for the regulation of gene expression.},

We examined the variation in the expression levels of 43 Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins, in cells grown under 11 experimental conditions. For all classes of genes and under all conditions, the expression variance was approximately proportional to the mean; the same scaling was observed at steady state and during the transient responses to the perturbations. Theoretical analysis suggests that this scaling behavior reflects variability in mRNA copy number, resulting from random 'birth and death' of mRNA molecules or from promoter fluctuations. Deviation of coexpressed genes from this general trend, including high noise in stress-related genes and low noise in proteasomal genes, may indicate fluctuations in pathway-specific regulators or a differential activation pattern of the underlying gene promoters.},

  abstract = {Cytokinesis is the process by which cells physically separate after the duplication and spatial segregation of the genetic material. A number of general principles apply to this process. First the microtubule cytoskeleton plays an important role in the choice and positioning of the division site. Once the site is chosen, the local assembly of the actomyosin contractile ring remodels the plasma membrane. Finally, membrane trafficking to and membrane fusion at the division site cause the physical separation of the daughter cells, a process termed abscission. Here we will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of cytokinesis in animals, yeast, and plants.},

Transcriptional output can be modulated by altering burst fraction or burst size, but how regulatory elements control bursting parameters remains unclear. Single-molecule RNA FISH experiments revealed that the {$\beta$}-globin enhancer (LCR) predominantly augments transcriptional burst fraction of the {$\beta$}-globin gene with modest stimulation of burst size. To specifically measure the impact of long-range chromatin contacts on transcriptional bursting, we forced an LCR-{$\beta$}-globin promoter chromatin loop. We observed that raising contact frequencies increases burst fraction but not burst size. In cells in which two developmentally distinct LCR-regulated globin genes are cotranscribed in cis, burst sizes of both genes are comparable. However, allelic co-transcription of both genes is statistically disfavored, suggesting mutually exclusive LCR-gene contacts. These results are consistent with competition between the {$\beta$}-type globin genes for LCR contacts and suggest that LCR-promoter loops are formed and released with rapid kinetics.},

  abstract = {The development of the mouse central nervous system (CNS) involves coordinated execution of transcriptional and epigenetic programs. These programs have been extensively studied through single-cell technologies in a pursuit to characterize the underlying cell heterogeneity. However, histone modifications pose additional layers of both positive and negative regulation that defines cellular identity. Here we show that the Cut\&Tag technology can be coupled with a droplet-based single cell library preparation platform to produce high quality chromatin modifications data at a single cell resolution in tens of thousands of cells. We apply single-cell Cut\&Tag (scC\&T) to probe histone modifications characteristic of active promoters (H3K4me3), active promoters and enhancers (H3K27ac), active gene bodies (H3K36me3) and inactive regions (H3K27me3) and generate scC\&T profiles for almost 50,000 cells. scC\&T profiles of each of these histone modifications were sufficient to determine cell identity and deconvolute at single cell level regulatory principles such as promoter bivalency, spreading of H3K4me3 and promoter-enhancer connectivity. Moreover, we used scC\&T to investigate the single-cell chromatin occupancy of transcription factor Olig2 and the cohesin complex component Rad21. Our results indicate that analysis of histone modifications and transcription factor occupancy at a single cell resolution can provide unique insights of epigenomic landscapes in the CNS. We also provide an online resource that can be used to interactively explore the data at https://castelobranco.shinyapps.io/BrainCutAndTag2020/.},

  abstract = {Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy for neurological diseases was revolutionized by the discovery that AAV9 crosses the blood\textendash brain barrier (BBB) after systemic administration. Transformative results have been documented in various inherited diseases, but overall neuronal transduction efficiency is relatively low. The recent development of AAV-PHP.B with {$\sim$}60-fold higher efficiency than AAV9 in transducing the adult mouse brain was the major first step toward acquiring the ability to deliver genes to the majority of cells in the central nervous system (CNS). However, little is known about the mechanism utilized by AAV to cross the BBB, and how it may diverge across species. In this study, we show that AAV-PHP.B is ineffective for systemic CNS gene transfer in the inbred strains BALB/cJ, BALB/cByJ, A/J, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HILtJ, C3H/HeJ, and CBA/J mice, but it is highly potent in C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ, DBA/2J, 129S1/SvImJ, and AKR/J mice and also the outbred strain CD-1. We used the power of classical genetics to uncover the molecular mechanisms AAV-PHP.B engages to transduce CNS at high efficiency, and by quantitative trait locus mapping we identify a 6 Mb region in chromosome 15 with an logarithm of the odds (LOD) score {$\sim$}20, including single nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding region of 9 different genes. Comparison of the publicly available data on the genome sequence of 16 different mouse strains, combined with RNA-seq data analysis of brain microcapillary endothelia, led us to conclude that the expression level of Ly6a is likely the determining factor for differential efficacy of AAV-PHP.B in transducing the CNS across different mouse strains.},

Using image-based transcriptomics in millions of single human cells, we find that while variability of cytoplasmic transcript abundance is large, it is for most genes minimally stochastic and can be predicted with multivariate models of the phenotypic state and population context of single cells. Computational multiplexing of these predictive signatures across hundreds of genes revealed a complex regulatory system that controls the observed variability of transcript abundance between individual cells. Mathematical modeling and experimental validation show that nuclear retention and transport of transcripts between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is central to buffering stochastic transcriptional fluctuations in mammalian gene expression. Our work indicates that cellular compartmentalization confines transcriptional noise to the nucleus, thereby preventing it from interfering with the control of single-cell transcript abundance in the cytoplasm.},

Here we report that the lethality of c-myc -/-embryos is also associated with profound defects in vasculogenesis and primitive erythropoiesis. Furthermore, c-myc -/-embryonic stem (ES) and yolk sac cells are compromised in their differentiative and growth potential. These defects are intrinsic to c-Myc, and are in part associated with a requirement for c-Myc for the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as VEGF can partially rescue these defects. However, c-Myc is also required for the proper expression of other angiogenic factors in ES and yolk sac cells, including angiopoietin-2, and the angiogenic inhibitors thrombospondin-1 and angiopoietin-1. Finally, c-myc -/- ES cells are dramatically impaired in their ability to form tumors in immune-compromised mice, and the small tumors that sometimes develop are poorly vascularized. Therefore, c-Myc function is also necessary for the angiogenic switch that is indispensable for the progression and metastasis of tumors. These findings support the model wherein c-Myc promotes cell growth and transformation, as well as vascular and hematopoietic development, by functioning as a master regulator of angiogenic factors.},

Cancers often exhibit an aberrant methylation of gene promoter regions that is associated with loss of gene function. This DNA change constitutes a heritable state, not mediated by altered nucleotide sequence, that appears to be tightly linked to the formation of transcriptionally repressive chromatin. This epigenetic process acts as an alternative to mutations to disrupt tumor-suppressor gene function and can predispose to genetic alterations through inactivating DNA-repair genes. Dissecting the molecular processes that mediate these methylation changes will enhance our understanding of chromatin modeling and gene regulation and might present novel possibilities for cancer therapy. Methylation changes constitute potentially sensitive molecular markers to define risk states, monitor prevention strategies, achieve early diagnosis, and track the prognosis of cancer.},

  abstract = {Transcription factors use DNA binding domains to recognise specific sequences and transactivation domains to recruit the cofactor proteins necessary for transcription. However, how specific cofactors contribute to transactivation at different genes remains unclear. Here, we couple Gal4-transactivation assays with comparative CRISPR-Cas9 screens to identify the cofactors required by nine different transcription factors and nine different core promoters in human cells. We classify cofactors as ubiquitous or specific, discover novel transcriptional co-dependencies and demonstrate that submodules within large co-activator complexes, such as the tail 2 and kinase modules of Mediator, facilitate transcriptional elongation. Rather than displaying discrete mechanisms of action, we discover that each TF requires a unique combination of cofactors, which influence its ability to potentiate distinct steps in the transcriptional process. Our findings help reconcile models of cofactor-promoter compatibility by demonstrating that transcription at different classes of promoters is constrained by either initiation or pause release. These differences dictate cofactor compatibility and the dynamic range of gene expression. Overall, our screens provide insight into TF-cofactor relationships and their ability to potentiate different steps in transcription at different classes of promoters.},

  abstract = {Enhancers can regulate the promoters of their target genes over very large genomic distances. It is widely assumed that mechanisms of enhancer action involve the reorganization of three-dimensional chromatin architecture, but this is poorly understood. The predominant model involves physical enhancer-promoter interaction by looping out the intervening chromatin. However, studying the enhancer-driven activation of the Sonic hedgehog gene (Shh), we have identified a change in chromosome conformation that is incompatible with this simple looping model. Using super-resolution 3D-FISH and chromosome conformation capture, we observe a decreased spatial proximity between Shh and its enhancers during the differentiation of embryonic stem cells to neural progenitors. We show that this can be recapitulated by synthetic enhancer activation, is impeded by chromatin-bound proteins located between the enhancer and the promoter, and appears to involve the catalytic activity of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Our data suggest that models of enhancer-promoter communication need to encompass chromatin conformations other than looping.},

First, we established that the human c-Myc protein can rescue lethal mutations of the Drosophila myc ortholog, dmyc, demonstrating the biological relevance of this model. Then, we characterized a new lethal dmyc insertion allele, which permits expression of human c-Myc in place of dMyc and used it to compare physiological activities of these isoforms in whole-organism rescue, transcription, cell growth, and apoptosis. These isoforms differ both quantitatively and qualitatively. Most remarkably, while the small c-MycS form truncated for much of its N-terminal trans-activation domain efficiently rescued viability and cell growth, it did not induce detectable programmed cell death. Our data indicate that the main functional difference between c-Myc isoforms resides in their apoptotic properties and that the N-terminal region, containing the conserved MbI motif, is decisive in governing the choice between growth and death.},

This view is challenged by large-scale studies correlating gene expression with posttranslational modifications of the histone proteins with which DNA is complexed in cells. Here, we show through a large-scale computational study that histone modifications can be predicted with remarkable accuracy from transcription factor-binding profiles, recapitulating known interactions between transcription factors and chromatin-modifying enzymes. Our results demonstrate that associations between gene expression and histone modifications do not necessarily imply a direct regulatory role for these modifications, but can be explained equally well as an indirect effect of interactions between transcription factors and chromatin-modifying enzymes., Gene expression in higher organisms is thought to be regulated by a complex network of transcription factor binding and chromatin modifications, yet the relative importance of these two factors remains a matter of debate. Here, we show that a computational approach allows surprisingly accurate prediction of histone modifications solely from knowledge of transcription factor binding both at promoters and at potential distal regulatory elements. This accuracy significantly and substantially exceeds what could be achieved by using DNA sequence as an input feature. Remarkably, we show that transcription factor binding enables strikingly accurate predictions across different cell lines. Analysis of the relative importance of specific transcription factors as predictors of specific histone marks recapitulated known interactions between transcription factors and histone modifiers. Our results demonstrate that reported associations between histone marks and gene expression may be indirect effects caused by interactions between transcription factors and histone-modifying complexes.},

Here we find, using a fast-acting, optogenetic transcription factor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that dynamic pulsatile signals reduce cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. We then show that by encoding such signals into a single input, expression mean and variability can be independently tuned. Further, we construct a light-responsive promoter library and demonstrate how pulsatile signaling also enables graded multi-gene regulation at fixed expression ratios, despite differences in promoter dose-response characteristics. Pulsatile regulation can thus lead to beneficial functional behaviors in synthetic biological systems, which previously required laborious optimization of genetic parts or the construction of synthetic gene networks.},

One model for the specificity of enhancer-promoter regulation is that different promoters might have sequence-encoded preferences for distinct classes of enhancers, for example mediated by interacting sets of transcription factors or cofactors. This ``biochemical compatibility'' model has been supported by observations at individual human promoters and by genome-wide measurements in Drosophila. However, the degree to which human enhancers and promoters are intrinsically compatible or specific has not been systematically measured, and how their activities combine to control RNA expression remains unclear. To address these questions, we designed a high-throughput reporter assay called enhancer x promoter (ExP) STARR-seq and applied it to examine the combinatorial compatibilities of 1,000 enhancer and 1,000 promoter sequences in human K562 cells. We identify a simple logic for enhancer-promoter compatibility \textendash{} virtually all enhancers activated all promoters by similar amounts, and intrinsic enhancer and promoter activities combine multiplicatively to determine RNA output (R2=0.82). In addition, two classes of enhancers and promoters showed subtle preferential effects. Promoters of housekeeping genes contained built-in activating sequences, corresponding to motifs for factors such as GABPA and YY1, that correlated with both stronger autonomous promoter activity and enhancer activity, and weaker responsiveness to distal enhancers. Promoters of context-specific genes lacked these motifs and showed stronger responsiveness to enhancers. Together, this systematic assessment of enhancer-promoter compatibility suggests a multiplicative model tuned by enhancer and promoter class to control gene transcription in the human genome.},

Malat1 RNA is expressed in numerous tissues and is highly abundant in neurons. It is enriched in nuclear speckles only when RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription is active. Knock-down studies revealed that Malat1 modulates the recruitment of SR family pre-mRNA-splicing factors to the transcription site of a transgene array. DNA microarray analysis in Malat1-depleted neuroblastoma cells indicates that Malat1 controls the expression of genes involved not only in nuclear processes, but also in synapse function. In cultured hippocampal neurons, knock-down of Malat1 decreases synaptic density, whereas its over-expression results in a cell-autonomous increase in synaptic density. Our results suggest that Malat1 regulates synapse formation by modulating the expression of genes involved in synapse formation and/or maintenance.},

This wealth of information has become increasingly difficult to follow, much less interpret. We have created a publicly available, continuously updated database that comprehensively catalogs all genetic association studies in the field of Alzheimer disease (http://www.alzgene.org). We performed systematic meta-analyses for each polymorphism with available genotype data in at least three case-control samples. In addition to identifying the epsilon4 allele of APOE and related effects, we pinpointed over a dozen potential Alzheimer disease susceptibility genes (ACE, CHRNB2, CST3, ESR1, GAPDHS, IDE, MTHFR, NCSTN, PRNP, PSEN1, TF, TFAM and TNF) with statistically significant allelic summary odds ratios (ranging from 1.11-1.38 for risk alleles and 0.92-0.67 for protective alleles). Our database provides a powerful tool for deciphering the genetics of Alzheimer disease, and it serves as a potential model for tracking the most viable gene candidates in other genetically complex diseases.},

In the same period, the microtubule-targeted tubulin-polymerizing agents (MTPAs), notably paclitaxel and taxotere, have come to occupy a central role in the treatment of a variety of human epithelial cancers. Following their binding to B-tubulin, MTPAs inhibit MT dynamic instability, cell cycle G2/M phase transition and mitotic arrest of cancer cells. MTPA-induced anti-MT and cell cycle effects trigger the molecular signaling for the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. This triggering is orchestrated through different molecular links and determined by the threshold for apoptosis that is set and controlled diversely in various cancer types. The complexity and regulatory potential of the links and the apoptosis threshold are integral to the transformed biology of the cancer cell. The emerging understanding of this biology and how it is influenced by treatment with MTPAs has highlighted novel strategies to further enhance the antitumor activity and overcome resistance to MTPA-induced apoptosis in cancer cells.},

TGF-beta-mediated EMT involves the stimulation of a number of signaling pathways by the sequential binding of the type II and type I serine/threonine kinase receptors, respectively. Integrins comprise a family of heterodimeric extracellular matrix receptors that mediate cell adhesion and intracellular signaling, hence making them crucial for EMT progression. In light of substantial evidence indicating TGF-beta regulation of various beta(1) integrins and their extracellular matrix ligands, we examined the cross-talk between the TGF-beta and integrin signal transduction pathways. Using an inducible system for the expression of a cytoplasmically truncated dominant negative TGF-beta type II receptor, we blocked TGF-beta-mediated growth inhibition, transcriptional activation, and EMT progression. Dominant negative TGF-beta type II receptor expression inhibited TGF-beta signaling to the SMAD and AKT pathways, but did not block TGF-beta-mediated p38MAPK activation. Interestingly, blocking integrin beta(1) function inhibited TGF-beta-mediated p38MAPK activation and EMT progression. Limiting p38MAPK activity through the expression of a dominant negative-p38MAPK also blocked TGF-beta-mediated EMT. In summary, TGF-beta-mediated p38MAPK activation is dependent on functional integrin beta(1), and p38MAPK activity is required but is not sufficient to induce EMT.},

We have generated Hi-C data from primary cardiac tissue and developed a method, peakHiC, for sensitive and quantitative loop calling to uncover the human heart regulatory interactome. We identify complex CTCF-dependent and -independent contact networks, with loops between coding and non-coding gene promoters, shared enhancers and repressive sites. Across the genome, enhancer interaction strength correlates with gene transcriptional output and loop dynamics follows CTCF, cohesin and H3K27Ac occupancy levels. Finally, we demonstrate that intersection of the human heart regulatory interactome with cardiovascular disease variants facilitates prioritizing disease-causative genes.},

An important question is whether cancer cells also contain a large number of random mutations, i.e., randomly distributed unselected mutations that occur in only one or a few cells of a tumor. Such random mutations could contribute to the morphologic and functional heterogeneity of cancers and include mutations that confer resistance to therapy. We have postulated that malignant cells exhibit a mutator phenotype resulting in the generation of random mutations throughout the genome. We have recently developed an assay to quantify random mutations in human tissue with unprecedented sensitivity. Here, we report measurements of random single-nucleotide substitutions in normal and neoplastic human tissues. In normal tissues, the frequency of spontaneous random mutations is exceedingly low, less than 1 \texttimes{} 10-8 per base pair. In contrast, tumors from the same individuals exhibited an average frequency of 210 \texttimes{} 10-8 per base pair, an elevation of at least two orders of magnitude. Our data document tumor heterogeneity at the single-nucleotide level, indicate that accelerated mutagenesis prevails late into tumor progression, and suggest that elevation of random mutation frequency in tumors might serve as a novel prognostic indicator.},

  abstract = {Imaging chromatin spatial organization The genome is organized within the nucleus as three-dimensional domains that modulate DNA-templated processes. Bintu et al. used high-throughput Oligopaint labeling and imaging to observe chromatin dynamics inside the nuclei of several different mammalian cell lines. After combining the datasets, single-cell matrices revealed chromatin arranged in topologically associating domains (TADs). Removing cohesin resulted in a loss of aggregate TADs among populations of cells, but specific TADs were still detected at the single-cell level. Furthermore, higher-order organization was detected, suggestive of cooperative interactions within the genome. Science, this issue p. eaau1783 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONChromatin adopts an intricate three-dimensional (3D) organization in the nucleus that is critical for many genome processes, from gene regulation to genome replication. Our understanding of the chromatin organization remains relatively poor at the kilobase-to-megabase scale, which spans the sizes of individual genes and regulatory domains and is thus of critical importance to genome regulation. Recent Hi-C experiments revealed topologically associating domains (TADs) as a ubiquitous chromatin organization feature in many organisms. However, the basic properties of TADs, including whether TADs represent a fundamental unit of genome organization in individual cells or an emergent property from cell population averaging, and the formation mechanism of TADs, remain unclear. In addition, our understanding of genome organization is largely built on pairwise interactions, whereas relatively little is known about higher-order chromatin interactions. Methods that provide a high-resolution visualization of chromatin structure in individual cells will elucidate these and many other questions related to genome organization. RATIONALEWe report a super-resolution chromatin tracing method that allows determination of both the structural features and their genomic coordinates with high resolution in single cells. We reason that if numerous chromatin loci could be identified and precisely localized in individual cells, connecting their positions would allow us to trace the chromatin conformation. However, typical multicolor imaging allows only a few loci to be simultaneously imaged. To overcome this challenge, we partitioned the targeted genomic region into numerous segments, each 30 kb in length, and imaged individual segments using sequential rounds of fluorescence in situ hybridization. This allowed us to generate a 3D super-resolution image of the chromatin in numerous pseudocolors, each reporting the position and structure of a 30-kb segment with nanometer-scale precision. RESULTSOur imaging data revealed an abundance of TAD-like domain structures with spatially segregated globular conformations in single cells. The domain boundaries varied from cell to cell, exhibiting nonzero probability of residing at any genome positions, but with a preference at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)- and cohesin-binding sites. Notably, cohesin depletion, which abolished TADs at the population-average level, did not alter the prevalence of TAD-like structures in single cells; only the preferential positioning of domain boundaries was lost, explaining the loss of population-level TADs. Our results suggest that cohesin is not required for the formation or maintenance of single-cell domain structures, but that their preferential boundary positions are influenced by cohesin-CTCF interaction.In addition, we observed prevalent multiway interactions among triplets of chromatin loci. These higher-order interactions were cooperative, i.e., most three-way contacts were observed at higher frequencies than would be expected from the frequency of pairwise interactions. Notably, these multiway interactions were also retained after cohesin depletion. CONCLUSIONOur imaging method offers a high-resolution physical view of chromatin conformation of targeted genomic regions in single cells, providing a powerful and complementary approach to sequencing-based genome-wide methods for interrogating genome organization. The TAD-like structures and multiway chromatin interactions observed in single cells add important constraints on genome folding and have implications for understanding the role of genome structure in diverse biological processes from enhancer-promoter communication to genome compartmentalization. We envision that future work will further improve the resolution and genomic coverage of this approach and will combine the imaging of chromatin with regulatory factors and/or expressed RNAs to reveal the underlying mechanism and functional implication of chromosome organization. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/362/6413/eaau1783/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Super-resolution chromatin tracing reveals TAD-like domain structures in single cells.Consecutive 30-kb segments of a chromatin region of interest were sequentially imaged with diffraction-limited or super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. The pseudocolored images of the positions of individual chromatin segments in single cells and the corresponding matrices of intersegment distances reveal TAD-like structures with a globular conformation in single cells. The population-average matrix reveals TADs at the ensemble level. The spatial organization of chromatin is pivotal for regulating genome functions. We report an imaging method for tracing chromatin organization with kilobase- and nanometer-scale resolution, unveiling chromatin conformation across topologically associating domains (TADs) in thousands of individual cells. Our imaging data revealed TAD-like structures with globular conformation and sharp domain boundaries in single cells. The boundaries varied from cell to cell, occurring with nonzero probabilities at all genomic positions but preferentially at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)- and cohesin-binding sites. Notably, cohesin depletion, which abolished TADs at the population-average level, did not diminish TAD-like structures in single cells but eliminated preferential domain boundary positions. Moreover, we observed widespread, cooperative, multiway chromatin interactions, which remained after cohesin depletion. These results provide critical insight into the mechanisms underlying chromatin domain and hub formation.

  abstract = {Quantitative analysis of epigenetic memory To explore quantitative and dynamic properties of transcriptional regulation by epigenetic modifications, Bintu et al. monitored a transcriptional reporter gene carried on a human artificial chromosome in Chinese hamster ovary cells (see the Perspective by Keung and Khalil). They measured effects of DNA methylation and histone modifications by methylation or deacetylation in single cells using time-lapse microscopy. Silencing was an all-or-none, stochastic event, so graded adjustments to transcription occurred from changes in the proportion of cells that responded. Furthermore, the duration of recruitment of the chromatin regulators determined the fraction of cells that were silenced. Thus, distinct modifiers can produce different characteristics of epigenetic memory. Science, this issue p. 720; see also p. 661 Chromatin regulators play a major role in establishing and maintaining gene expression states. Yet how they control gene expression in single cells, quantitatively and over time, remains unclear. We used time-lapse microscopy to analyze the dynamic effects of four silencers associated with diverse modifications: DNA methylation, histone deacetylation, and histone methylation. For all regulators, silencing and reactivation occurred in all-or-none events, enabling the regulators to modulate the fraction of cells silenced rather than the amount of gene expression. These dynamics could be described by a three-state model involving stochastic transitions between active, reversibly silent, and irreversibly silent states. Through their individual transition rates, these regulators operate over different time scales and generate distinct types of epigenetic memory. Our results provide a framework for understanding and engineering mammalian chromatin regulation and epigenetic memory. Quantitative, single-cell measurements reveal characteristics of epigenetic control of transcription.

We utilize deactivated Cas9 (dCas9)-based gene activation to target 1,496 putative transcription factors (TFs) in the human genome. Using a reporter of neuronal commitment, we profile the neurogenic activity of these factors in human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), leading to a curated set of pro-neuronal factors. Activation of pairs of TFs reveals neuronal cofactors, including E2F7, RUNX3, and LHX8, that improve conversion efficiency, subtype specificity, and maturation of neuronal cell types. Finally, using multiplexed gene regulation with orthogonal CRISPR systems, we demonstrate improved neuronal differentiation with concurrent activation and repression of target genes, underscoring the power of CRISPR-based gene regulation for programming complex cellular phenotypes.},

Furthermore, we explore the propagation of noise in a gene cascade network and demonstrate experimentally that increased noise in the transcription of a regulatory protein leads to increased cell\textendash cell variability in the target gene output, resulting in prolonged bistable expression states.

We rationally introduce mutations within the TATA region of an engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL1 promoter and measure promoter responses that can be characterized as being either highly variable and rapid or steady and slow. We computationally illustrate how a stable transcription scaffold can result in "bursts" of gene expression, enabling rapid individual cell responses in the transient and increased cell-cell variability at steady state.

  abstract = {Although it is now well-established that boundary elements/insulators function to subdivide eukaryotic chromosomes into autonomous regulatory domains, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. One idea is that boundaries act as barriers, preventing the processive spreading of ``active'' or ``silenced'' chromatin between domains. Another is that the partitioning into autonomous functional units is a consequence of an underlying structural subdivision of the chromosome into higher order ``looped'' domains. In this view, boundaries are thought to delimit structural domains by interacting with each other or with some other nuclear structure. The studies reported here provide support for the looped domain model. We show that the Drosophila scs and scs` boundary proteins, Zw5 and BEAF, respectively, interact with each other in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, consistent with idea that this protein:protein interaction might facilitate pairing of boundary elements, we find that that scs and scs` are in close proximity to each other in Drosophila nuclei.},

  abstract = {Previously we have shown that hypoxia strongly induces the expression of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 and -4 (PFKFB-3 and PFKFB-4) genes in several cancer cell lines via a HIF-dependent mechanism. In this paper we studied the expression and hypoxic regulation of PFKFB-4 and PFKFB-3 mRNA as well as its correlation with HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, VEGF and Glut1 mRNA expression in the pancreatic cancer cell line Panc1 and two gastric cancer cell lines MKN45 and NUGC3. This study clearly demonstrated that PFKFB-3 and PFKFB-4 mRNA are expresses in MKN45, NUGC3 and Panc1 cancers cells and that both genes are responsive to hypoxia in vitro. However, their basal level of expression and hypoxia responsiveness vary in the different cells studied. Particularly, PFKFB-3 mRNA is highly expressed in MKN45 and NUGC3 cancer cells, with the highest response to hypoxia in the NUGC3 cell line. The PFKFB-4 mRNA has a variable low basal level of expression in both gastric and pancreatic cancer cell lines. However, the highest hypoxia response of PFKFB-4 mRNA is found in the pancreatic cancer cell line Panc1. The basal level of PFKFB-4 protein expression is the highest in NUGC3 gastric cancer cell line and lowest in Panc1 cells, with the highest response to hypoxia in the pancreatic cancer cell line. Further studies showed that PFKFB-3 and PFKFB-4 gene expression was highly responsive to the hypoxia mimic dimethyloxalylglycine, a specific inhibitor of HIF-alpha hydroxylase enzymes, suggesting that the hypoxia responsiveness of PFKFB-3 and PFKFB-4 genes in these cell lines is regulated by the HIF transcription complex. The expression of VEGF and Glut1, which are known HIF-dependent genes, is also strongly induced under hypoxic conditions in gastric and pancreatic cancer cell lines. The levels of HIF-1alpha protein are increased in both gastric and pancreatic cancer cell lines under hypoxic conditions. However, the basal level of HIF-1alpha as well as HIF-2alpha mRNA expression and their hypoxia responsiveness are different in the MKN45 and NUGC3 cancer cells. Thus, the expression of HIF-1alpha mRNA is decreased in both gastric cancer cell lines treated by hypoxia or dimethyloxalylglycine, but HIF-2alpha mRNA expression is not changed significantly in NUGC3 and slightly increased in MKN45 cells. Expression of PFKFB-4 and PFKFB-3 was also studied in gastric cancers and corresponding nonmalignant tissue counterparts from the same patients on both the mRNA and protein levels. The expression of PFKFB-3 and PFKFB-4 mRNA as well as PFKFB-1 and PFKFB-2 mRNA was observed in normal human gastric tissue and was increased in malignant gastric tumors. The basal level of PFKFB-4 protein expression in gastric cancers was much higher as compared to the PFKFB-3 isoenzyme. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that PFKFB-4 and PFKFB-3 genes are also expressed in gastric and pancreatic cancer cells, they strongly respond to hypoxia via a HIF-1alpha dependent mechanism and, together with the expression of PFKFB-1 and PFKFB-2 genes, possibly have a significant role in the Warburg effect which is found in malignant cells.},

  abstract = {The expression of genes with a key function during development is frequently controlled by large regulatory landscapes containing multiple enhancer elements. These landscapes often match Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) and sometimes integrate range of similar enhancers, thus leading to TADs having a global regulatory specificity. To assess the relative functional importance of enhancer sequences versus the regulatory domain they are included in, we set out to transfer one particular enhancer sequence from its native domain into a TAD with a closely related, yet different functional specificity. We used Hoxd genes and their biphasic regulation during limb development as a paradigm, since they are first activated in proximal limb cells by enhancers located in one TAD, which is then silenced at the time when the neighboring TAD starts to activate its enhancers in distal limb cells. We introduced a strong distal limb enhancer into the proximal limb TAD and found that its new context strongly suppresses its distal specificity, even though it continues to be bound by HOX13 transcription factors, which normally are responsible for this activity. Using local genetic alterations and chromatin conformation measurements, we see that the enhancer is capable of interacting with target genes, with a pattern comparable to its adoptive neighborhood of enhancers. Its activity in distal limb cells can be rescued only when a large portion of the surrounding environment is removed. These results indicate that, at least in some cases, the functioning of enhancer elements is subordinated to the local chromatin context, which can exert a dominant control over its activity.},

However, we still have no clear understanding of the repercussions of this heterogeneity, given the lack of tools to independently control mean expression and variability of a gene. Here, we engineer a synthetic circuit to modulate mean expression and heterogeneity of transgenes and endogenous human genes. The circuit, a Tunable Noise Rheostat (TuNR), consists of a transcriptional cascade of two inducible transcriptional activators, where the output mean and variance can be modulated by two orthogonal small molecule inputs. In this fashion, different combinations of the inputs can achieve the same mean but with different population variability. With TuNR, we achieve low basal expression, over 1000-fold expression of a transgene product, and up to 7-fold induction of the endogenous gene NGFR. Importantly, for the same mean expression level, we are able to establish varying degrees of heterogeneity in expression within an isogenic population, thereby decoupling gene expression noise from its mean. TuNR is therefore a modular tool that can be used in mammalian cells to enable direct interrogation of the implications of cell-to-cell variability.},

  abstract = {Although use of embryonic or seedling tissues for mass clonal micropropagation in vitro in conifer reforestation programmes is questionable, there is a potential application in the regeneration of plants from scarce and costly seed derived from controlled pollination. In addition, in vitro culture shortens considerably the lag phase in numbers during the initial stages of vegetative propagation via rooted cuttings. Successive steps of the present technique are described whereby cotyledonary needles (secondary explants) were subcultured on a hormone-free medium after administration of cytokinin or auxin to 14-day-old seedling (primary) explants of Picea abies. For bud induction, N6-benzyladenine (BA) was applied either as a short-duration (3 h), high-concentration (125 {$\mu$}M) pulse or by vacuum infiltration and incubation in a BA-containmg (5 {$\mu$}M) infusion medium. Induced adventitious shoots were elongated with the aid of far-red light and rooted in vivo after a long-duration (12 h), high-concentration (625 {$\mu$}M) application of indolebutyric acid. Pulse and infusion treatments resulted in the induction of greater numbers of adventitious buds (average of 12 per needle) over a three to four week shorter culture period than was the case with the conventional inclusion of growth regulators in the agarified medium. No exogenous auxin was required in the bud-induction programme; its inclusion even at nanomolar levels promoted histo- rather than morphogenesis. In cotyledonary needles, to the primary explants of which BA was applied as a pulse or by infusion, the cell divisions which gave rise to the meristemoids from which adventitious buds were produced, appeared to commence mainly in undifferentiated hypodermal layer cells but also in the mesophyll immediately below. By contrast, where BA was incorporated in the agarified medium the first divisions occurred mainly in cells of the epidermal layer.A number of factors affected plantlet regeneration, for instance seed variability, age of seedlings, and mode of application of growth substances. It should also be accepted that the xeromorphic nature of the conifer leaf might impose physiological and morphological constraints on its culture in vitro that could militate against easy morphogenic manipulation. It is deemed essential that the current mean ratio of regenerated plants to cotyledonary needles of 1:1 be increased 10 to 20 fold in order to approach commercial feasibility.},

CTCF is involved in diverse nuclear activities, and recent studies suggest that the proteins with which it associates and the DNA sequences that it targets may underlie these various roles. Here we show that the Drosophila homolog of CTCF (dCTCF) aligns in the genome with other Drosophila insulator proteins such as Suppressor of Hairy wing [SU(HW)] and Boundary Element Associated Factor of 32 kDa (BEAF-32) at the borders of H3K27me3 domains, which are also enriched for associated insulator proteins and additional cofactors. RNAi depletion of dCTCF and combinatorial knockdown of gene expression for other Drosophila insulator proteins leads to a reduction in H3K27me3 levels within repressed domains, suggesting that insulators are important for the maintenance of appropriate repressive chromatin structure in Polycomb (Pc) domains. These results shed new insights into the roles of insulators in chromatin domain organization and support recent models suggesting that insulators underlie interactions important for Pc-mediated repression. We reveal an important relationship between dCTCF and other Drosophila insulator proteins and speculate that vertebrate CTCF may also align with other nuclear proteins to accomplish similar functions.},

Expression studies at the cell population level and in individual cells before and after induction of differentiation with hemin or DMSO show that the presence of these enhancers is associated with variegated patterns of expression. We were able to show that the LCR fragments tested act by controlling both the probability of expression and the rate of transcription of the linked beta-globin promoter. Both of these factors were also dependent on the state of differentiation of the MELc and on the presence of a second transcription unit located in cis. The ability to manipulate by RMCE constructs integrated into chromosomes should help in the creation of complex, rationally designed, artificial genetic loci.},

More recently, the genes and signals involved in the invasion and transendothelial migration of cancer cells, such as the role of adhesion molecules and matrix degrading enzymes, have become the focus of research. In this review we discuss how the structural and biomechanical properties of extracellular matrix and surrounding cells such as endothelial cells influence cancer cell motility and invasion.

However, when comparing central areas of primary colorectal carcinomas and corresponding metastases, we again found the same differentiated epithelial growth patterns. These characteristic phenotypic changes were associated with distinct expression patterns of {$\beta$}-catenin, the main oncogenic protein in colorectal carcinomas, and E-cadherin. Nuclear {$\beta$}-catenin was found in dedifferentiated mesenchyme-like tumor cells at the invasive front, but strikingly, as in central areas of the primary tumors, was localized to the membrane and cytoplasm in polarized epithelial tumor cells in the metastases. This expression pattern was accompanied by changes in E-cadherin expression and proliferative activity. On the basis of these data, we postulate that an important driving force for progression of well-differentiated colorectal carcinomas is the specific environment, initiating two transient phenotypic transition processes by modulating intracellular {$\beta$}-catenin distribution in tumor cells.},

Chronic UVB exposure drives clonal expansion by a non-mutational mechanism, and this mechanism allows mutant stem cells to escape from their own stem cell compartment and colonize adjacent compartments. In the absence of escape, cells proliferate without occupying additional territory. The non-mutational clonal expansion mechanism appears to be UVB-induced apoptosis, which deletes DNA-damaged cells in unmutated stem cell compartments but will preferentially spare death-resistant p53-mutant cells. An additional source of apoptotic selection pressure may come from UV-irradiated melanin.},

Other skeletal abnormalities, except for complete ossification of the sternum, were not apparent.

Northern blot analysis demonstrated normal levels of muscle-specific mRNAs including MyoD, myogenin, and Myf-6. However, the appearance of myotomal cells in early somites was delayed by several days.

While high-throughput AAV engineering and selection methods have generated numerous variants, subsequent tropism and response characterization have remained low throughput and lack resolution across the many relevant cell and tissue types. To fully leverage the output of these large screening paradigms across multiple targets, we have developed an experimental and computational single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) pipeline for in vivo characterization of barcoded rAAV pools at high resolution. Using this platform, we have both corroborated previously reported viral tropisms and discovered unidentified AAV capsid targeting biases. As expected, we observed that the tropism profile of AAV.CAP-B10 in mice was shifted toward neurons and away from astrocytes when compared with AAV-PHP.eB. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that this neuronal bias is due mainly to increased targeting efficiency for glutamatergic neurons, which we confirmed by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization. We further uncovered cell subtype tropisms of AAV variants in vascular and glial cells, such as low transduction of pericytes and Myoc+ astrocytes. Additionally, we have observed cell-type-specific transitory responses to systemic AAV-PHP.eB administration, such as upregulation of genes involved in p53 signaling in endothelial cells three days post-injection, which return to control levels by day twenty-five. The presented experimental and computational approaches for parallel characterization of AAV tropism will facilitate the advancement of safe and precise gene delivery vehicles, and showcase the power of understanding responses to gene therapies at the single-cell level.},

To identify effector proteins that mediate this function, we performed mass spectrometry on N-MYC complexes in neuroblastoma cells. The analysis shows that N-MYC forms complexes with TFIIIC, TOP2A, and RAD21, a subunit of cohesin. N-MYC and TFIIIC bind to overlapping sites in thousands of Pol II promoters and intergenic regions. TFIIIC promotes association of RAD21 with N-MYC target sites and is required for N-MYC-dependent promoter escape and pause release of Pol II. Aurora-A competes with binding of TFIIIC and RAD21 to N-MYC in~vitro and antagonizes association of TOP2A, TFIIIC, and RAD21 with N-MYC during S phase, blocking N-MYC-dependent release of Pol II from the promoter. Inhibition of Aurora-A in S phase restores RAD21 and TFIIIC binding to chromatin and partially restores N-MYC-dependent transcriptional elongation.

We show that repressor-activator protein 1 (Rap1), a master regulator of yeast metabolism, binds to an expanded target set after glucose depletion despite decreasing protein levels and no evidence of posttranslational modification. Computational analysis predicts that proteins capable of recruiting the chromatin regulator Tup1 act to restrict the binding distribution of Rap1 in the presence of glucose. Deletion of the gene(s) encoding Tup1, recruiters of Tup1 or chromatin regulators recruited by Tup1 cause Rap1 to bind specifically and inappropriately to low-glucose targets. These data, combined with whole-genome measurements of nucleosome occupancy and Tup1 distribution, provide evidence for a mechanism of dynamic target specification that coordinates the genome-wide distribution of intermediate-affinity DNA sequence motifs with chromatin-mediated regulation of accessibility to those sites.},

  abstract = {We analyzed the function of the downstream promoter element (DPE), a distinct 7-nucleotide core promoter element that is {$\sim$}30 nucleotides downstream of the transcription start site of many TATA-box-deficient (TATA-less) promoters in Drosophila. There is a strict requirement for spacing between the Inr and DPE motifs, as an increase or decrease of 3 nucleotides in the distance between the Inr and DPE causes a seven- to eightfold reduction in transcription as well as a significant reduction in the binding of purified TFIID. These results suggest a specific and somewhat rigid interaction of TFIID with the Inr and DPE sequences. Photo-cross-linking analysis of purified TFIID with a TATA-less DPE-containing promoter revealed specific cross-linking of dTAFII60 and dTAFII40 to the DPE, with a higher efficiency of cross-linking to dTAFII60 than to dTAFII40. These data, combined with the previously well-characterized interactions between the two TAFs and their homology to histones H4 and H3, suggest that a dTAFII60\textendash dTAFII40 heterotetramer binds to the DPE. Human and Drosophila transcription factors exhibit essentially the same requirements for DPE sequence and for Inr\textendash DPE spacing. In addition, the TATA-less promoter of the human interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) gene contains a DPE that is important for transcriptional activity both in vitro and in cultured cells. Hence, these studies provide evidence for a direct role of TAFs in basal transcription of TATA-less DPE-containing genes and collectively indicate that the DPE is, in many respects, a downstream counterpart to the TATA box that is present in Drosophila to humans.},

DNase I footprinting of the binding of eTFIID to TATA-less promoters revealed that the factor protected a region that extended from the initiation site sequence (about +1) to approximately 35 nucleotides downstream of the RNA start site. In contrast, there was no apparent upstream DNase I protection or hypersensitivity induced by eTFIID in the -25 to -30 region at which TATA motifs are typically located. Further studies revealed a conserved sequence motif, (A/G)G(A/T)CGTG, termed the downstream promoter element (DPE), which is located approximately 30 nucleotides downstream of the RNA start site of many TATA-less promoters. DNase I footprinting and in vitro transcription experiments revealed that a DPE in its normal downstream location is necessary for transcription of DPE-containing TATA-less promoters and can compensate for the disruption of an upstream TATA box of a TATA-containing promoter. Moreover, a systematic mutational analysis of DNA sequences that encompass the DPE confirmed the importance of the consensus DPE sequence motif for basal transcription and further supports the postulate that the DPE is a distinct, downstream basal promoter element. These results suggest that the DPE acts in conjunction with the initiation site sequence to provide a binding site for TFIID in the absence of a TATA box to mediate transcription of TATA-less promoters.},

  abstract = {Insulators are protein-bound DNA elements that are thought to play a role in chromatin organization and the regulation of gene expression by mediating intra- and interchromosomal interactions. Suppressor of Hair-wing [Su(Hw)] and Drosophila CTCF (dCTCF) insulators are found at distinct loci throughout the Drosophila melanogaster genome and function by recruiting an additional protein, Centrosomal Protein 190 (CP190). We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and microarray analysis (ChIP\textendash chip) experiments with whole-genome tiling arrays to compare Su(Hw), dCTCF, boundary element-associated factor (BEAF), and CP190 localization on DNA in two different cell lines and found evidence that BEAF is a third subclass of CP190-containing insulators. The DNA-binding proteins Su(Hw), dCTCF, and BEAF show unique distribution patterns with respect to the location and expression level of genes, suggesting diverse roles for these three subclasses of insulators in genome organization. Notably, cell line-specific localization sites for all three DNA-binding proteins as well as CP190 indicate multiple levels at which insulators can be regulated to affect gene expression. These findings suggest a model in which insulator subclasses may have distinct functions that together organize the genome in a cell type-specific manner, resulting in differential regulation of gene expression.},

  abstract = {Homeotic genes determine the developmental fates of cells. Restriction of their expression along the body axis is of prime importance for normal development. We searched for cis-regulatory sequences within Abdominal-B (Abd-B), a homeotic Drosophila gene, by testing genomic Abd-B fragments for their ability to confer beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) expression in transformed embryos. One of the Abd-B fragments, called IAB5, mediates a beta-gal pattern restricted along the body axis to the Abd-B expression domain. Alterations of the IAB5 pattern in gap mutants provide evidence that the protein products of the gap genes hunchback, Kr\"uppel and knirps act as repressors through IAB5. The anterior Abd-B expression limit is apparently determined by Kr\"uppel repression, whereas the knirps repressor may be responsible for the graded Abd-B expression within the Abd-B domain. IAB5 and two other fragments called MCP and FAB show region-specific silencing activity: they suppress at a distance beta-gal expression mediated by a linked heterologous enhancer. Silencing requires hunchback as well as Polycomb function and evidently provides maintenance of Abd-B expression limits throughout embryogenesis. We conclude that transcriptional repression is a key mechanism operating at multiple levels to control Abd-B expression. The striking similarities between the control of Abd-B and of Ultrabithorax, another homeotic Drosophila gene, may point to a universal principle underlying homeotic gene regulation.},

By iterative integration of ICRs and related DNA sequences to an ectopic location in the mouse genome, we first identify the DNA sequence features required for maintenance of epigenetic states in embryonic stem cells. The autonomous regulatory properties of ICRs further enabled us to create DNA-methylation-sensitive reporters and to screen for key components involved in regulating their epigenetic memory. Besides DNMT1, UHRF1 and ZFP57, we identify factors that prevent switching from methylated to unmethylated states and show that two of these candidates, ATF7IP and ZMYM2, are important for the stability of DNA and H3K9 methylation at ICRs in embryonic stem cells.},

We found that lincRNA expression is strikingly tissue-specific compared with coding genes, and that lincRNAs are typically coexpressed with their neighboring genes, albeit to an extent similar to that of pairs of neighboring protein-coding genes. We distinguish an additional subset of transcripts that have high evolutionary conservation but may include short ORFs and may serve as either lincRNAs or small peptides. Our integrated, comprehensive, yet conservative reference catalog of human lincRNAs reveals the global properties of lincRNAs and will facilitate experimental studies and further functional classification of these genes.},

Here we demonstrate that both insulators block the interaction of defined even-skipped (eve) stripe enhancers6,7 when positioned between the enhancer and the target promoter. The simultaneous use of two stripe enhancers (eve stripes 2 and 3) provides evidence that enhancers lying distal to the insulator are selectively blocked.

These results suggest that insulators do not propagate changes in chromatin structure.

Taken together, these results suggest that insulators might not be restricted to the functional isolation of neighbouring genetic loci.

Our previous study showed that insulators do not merely function as rigid blockers, rather their activities are quantitative and selective. We have investigated the factors and mechanisms that determine the effectiveness of the suHw insulator in transgenic Drosophila. We show that the suHw-mediated blockage of the AE1 enhancer from a downstream promoter depends on the ability of the promoter to compete for AE1. Promoters that are highly competitive for the enhancer are blocked less effectively. Moreover, blockage of AE1 from its cognate ftz promoter can range from virtually complete to non-detectable, depending on the property of the neighboring upstream promoter. A highly competitive neighboring promoter enhances the suHw-mediated blockage, whereas a less competitive promoter reduces the insulator effectiveness. The influence on insulator effectiveness by both the interacting and the neighboring competing promoters correlates with their ability to compete for the enhancer, which was previously shown to depend on core promoter sequences. Our findings suggest a mechanism at the level of gene organization that modulates insulator effectiveness through promoter competition. The dependence of insulator function on its cis contexts may provide it with more regulatory flexibility while imposing organizational restraints on eukaryotic gene complexes.},

  abstract = {The high rate of glycolysis despite the presence of oxygen in tumor cells (Warburg effect) suggests an important role for this process in cell division. The glycolytic rate is dependent on the cellular concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2), which, in turn, is controlled by the bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2). The ubiquitous PFK-2 isoenzyme (uPFK-2, alternatively named UBI2K5 or ACG) coded by the pfkfb3 gene is induced by different stimuli (serum, progesterone, insulin, hypoxia, etc.) and has the highest kinase/phosphatase activity ratio amongst all PFK-2 isoenzymes discovered to date, which is consistent with its role as a powerful activator of glycolysis. uPFK-2 is expressed in brain, placenta, transformed cells and proliferating cells. In the present work, we analyze the impact of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced silencing of uPFK-2 on the inhibition of cell proliferation. HeLa cells treated with uPFK-2 siRNA showed a decrease in uPFK-2 RNA levels measured at 24h. uPFK-2 protein levels were severely depleted at 48\textendash 72h when compared with cells treated with an unrelated siRNA, correlating with decreased glycolytic activity, Fru-2,6-P2, lactate and ATP concentrations. These metabolic changes led to reduced viability, cell-cycle delay and an increase in the population of apoptotic cells. Moreover, uPFK-2 suppression inhibited anchorage-independent growth. The results obtained highlight the importance of uPFK-2 on the regulation of glycolysis, on cell viability and proliferation and also on anchorage-independent growth. These data underscore the potential for uPFK-2 as an effective tumor therapeutic target.},

Here, we create a viral toolkit for one such method, calling cards, and demonstrate that these reagents can be delivered to the live mouse brain and used to report TF occupancy. Further, we establish a Cre-dependent calling cards system and, in proof-of-principle experiments, show utility in defining cell type-specific TF profiles and recording and integrating TF-binding events across time.

The "blue silver" exhibits a much faster dye uptake (80\% during the first hour of coloration, vs. none with a commercial preparation from Sigma). Even at equilibrium (24 h staining), the "blue silver" exhibits a much higher sensitivity than all other recipes, approaching (but lower than) the one of the classical silver stain. Measurements of stain sensitivity after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of bovine serum albumin (BSA) gave a detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio {$>$} 3) of 1 ng in a single zone. The somewhat lower sensitivity of "blue silver" as compared to classical silvering protocols in the presence of aldehydes is amply compensated for by its full compatibility with mass spectrometry of eluted polypeptide chains, after a two-dimensional map analysis, thus confirming that no dye is covalently bound (or permanently modifies) to any residue in the proteinaceous material. It is believed that the higher level of phosphoric acid in the recipe, thus its lower final pH, helps in protonating the last dissociated residues of Asp and Glu in the polypeptide coils, thus greatly favoring ionic anchoring of dye molecules to the protein moiety. Such a binding, though, must be followed by considerable hydrophobic association with the aromatic and hydrophobic residues along the polypeptide backbone.},

In this study, different human neoplastic cell lines of epithelial origin were exposed to hypoxic conditions in order to investigate whether hypoxia per se may trigger EMT programme as well as to mechanistically elucidate signal transduction mechanisms involved. The following human cancer cell lines were used: HepG2 (from human hepatoblastoma), PANC-1 (from pancreatic carcinoma), HT-29 (from colon carcinoma) and MCF-7 (from breast carcinoma). Cancer cells were exposed to carefully controlled hypoxic conditions and investigated for EMT changes and signal transduction by using morphological, cell and molecular biology techniques. All cancer cells responded to hypoxia within 72 h by classic EMT changes (fibroblastoid phenotype, SNAIL and beta-catenin nuclear translocation and changes in E-cadherin) and by increased migration and invasiveness. This was involving very early inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), early SNAIL translocation as well as later and long-lasting activation of Wnt/beta-catenin-signalling machinery. Experimental manipulation, including silencing of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and the specific inhibition of mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), revealed that early EMT-related events induced by hypoxia (GSK-3beta inhibition and SNAIL translocation) were dependent on transient intracellular increased generation of ROS whereas late migration and invasiveness were sustained by HIF-1alpha- and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent mechanisms. These findings indicate that in cancer cells, early redox mechanisms can switch on hypoxia-dependent EMT programme whereas increased invasiveness is sustained by late and HIF-1alpha-dependent release of VEGF.},

We compared SALL4 with OCT4 in all GCTs, and SALL4 to alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and glypican-3 in all YSTs. To test SALL4 specificity, 23 testicular non-GCTs (10 Leydig cell tumors, 4 Sertoli cell tumors, 3 adenomatoid tumors, 3 paratesticular rhabdomyosarcomas, 2 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, and 1 rete testis papillary cystadenoma) and 275 nontesticular tumors (158 metastatic carcinomas, 12 metastatic melanomas, 11 primary and 2 metastatic mesotheliomas, and 72 primary and 20 metastatic sarcomas) were also stained for SALL4. All ITGCNs, classic seminomas, and ECs demonstrated strong SALL4 and OCT4 staining in more than 90\% tumor cells. All 31 YSTs (5 pediatric and 26 postpubertal) showed strong positive SALL4 staining in more than 90\% tumor cells but had negative OCT4 staining. Both spermatocytic seminomas showed positive SALL4 staining in 80\% to 95\% tumor cells in all 3 types of tumor cells with weak-to-moderate staining intensity. Mononucleated trophoblastic cells were variably positive for SALL4 staining in all 5 choriocarcinomas. Focal SALL4 staining was seen in 4 of 7 pediatric and 23 of 27 postpubertal teratomas. OCT4 staining was not seen in any spermatocytic seminoma, choriocarcinoma, or teratoma. No SALL4 staining was seen in all 23 testicular non-GCTs. Of 275 nontesticular tumors, only 10 carcinomas and 1 sarcoma showed focal ({$<$}25\% tumor cells) weak SALL4 staining. The only non-neoplastic cells within the testis stained with SALL4 were spermatogonia and few primary spermatocytes. AFP staining was seen in 29 of 31 YST but it was often focal and patchy. Although all 31 YSTs showed glypican-3 staining, 14 (45\%) show staining in less than 30\% tumor cells. Our findings indicate that SALL4 is a novel sensitive and relatively specific marker for testicular GCTs. SALL4 is a more sensitive marker than AFP and glypican-3 for YST.},

We have sequenced tags corresponding to several hundred thousand transcription start sites (TSSs) in the mouse and human genomes, allowing precise analysis of the sequence architecture and evolution of distinct promoter classes. Different tissues and families of genes differentially use distinct types of promoters. Our tagging methods allow quantitative analysis of promoter usage in different tissues and show that differentially regulated alternative TSSs are a common feature in protein-coding genes and commonly generate alternative N termini. Among the TSSs, we identified new start sites associated with the majority of exons and with 3' UTRs. These data permit genome-scale identification of tissue-specific promoters and analysis of the cis-acting elements associated with them.},

It discriminates against aminoacyl transfer RNAs that do not match the codon of messenger RNA, thereby ensuring accuracy in translation of the genetic message in a process called decoding. Also, it works with the 50S subunit to move the tRNAs and associated mRNA by precisely one codon, in a process called translocation. Here we describe the functional implications of the high-resolution 30S crystal structure presented in the accompanying paper, and infer details of the interactions between the 30S subunit and its tRNA and mRNA ligands. We also describe the crystal structure of the 30S subunit complexed with the antibiotics paromomycin, streptomycin and spectinomycin, which interfere with decoding and translocation. This work reveals the structural basis for the action of these antibiotics, and leads to a model for the role of the universally conserved 16S RNA residues A1492 and A1493 in the decoding process.},

  abstract = {Transcription and genome architecture are interdependent, but it is still unclear how nucleosomes in the chromatin fiber interact with nascent RNA, and which is the relative nuclear distribution of these RNAs and elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). Using super-resolution (SR) microscopy, we visualized the nascent transcriptome, in both nucleoplasm and nucleolus, with nanoscale resolution. We found that nascent RNAs organize in structures we termed RNA nanodomains, whose characteristics are independent of the number of transcripts produced over time. Dual-color SR imaging of nascent RNAs, together with elongating RNAP II and H2B, shows the physical relation between nucleosome clutches, RNAP II, and RNA nanodomains. The distance between nucleosome clutches and RNA nanodomains is larger than the distance measured between elongating RNAP II and RNA nanodomains. Elongating RNAP II stands between nascent RNAs and the small, transcriptionally active, nucleosome clutches. Moreover, RNA factories are small and largely formed by few RNAP II. Finally, we describe a novel approach to quantify the transcriptional activity at an individual gene locus. By measuring local nascent RNA accumulation upon transcriptional activation at single alleles, we confirm the measurements made at the global nuclear level.},

We added 298 new profiles to the Unvalidated collection when no orthogonal evidence was found in the literature. All the profiles were clustered to provide familial binding profiles for each taxonomic group. Moreover, we revised the structural classification of DNA binding domains to consider plant-specific TFs. This release introduces word clouds to represent the scientific knowledge associated with each TF. We updated the genome tracks of TFBSs predicted with JASPAR profiles in eight organisms; the human and mouse TFBS predictions can be visualized as native tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser. Finally, we provide a new tool to perform JASPAR TFBS enrichment analysis in user-provided genomic regions.

This revealed different types of chromatin structures including topologically associating domains, partitioning genes and their enhancers into interacting domains. While the visualisation of these topologies and their dynamics has dramatically improved, our understanding of their underlying mechanisms and functional roles in gene expression has lagged behind. A suite of recent studies have addressed this using genetic manipulations to perturb topological features and loops at different scales. Here we assess the new biological insights gained on the functional relationship between genome topology and gene expression, with a particular focus on enhancer function.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional control by distal enhancers is an integral feature of gene regulation. To understand how enhancer-promoter interactions arise and assess the impact of disrupting 3D chromatin structure on gene expression, we generated an allelic series of mouse mutants that perturb the physical structure of the Sox2 locus. We show that in the epiblast and in neuronal tissues, CTCF-mediated loops are neither required for the interaction of the Sox2 promoter with distal enhancers, nor for its expression. Insertion of various combinations of CTCF motifs between Sox2 and its distal enhancers generated ectopic loops with varying degrees of insulation that directly correlated with reduced transcriptional output. Yet, even the mutants exhibiting the strongest insulation, with six CTCF motifs in divergent orientation, could not fully abolish activation by distal enhancers, and failed to disrupt implantation and neurogenesis. In contrast, cells of the anterior foregut were more susceptible to chromatin structure disruption with no detectable SOX2 expression in mutants with the strongest CTCF-mediated boundaries. These animals phenocopied loss of SOX2 in the anterior foregut, failed to separate trachea from esophagus and died perinatally. We propose that baseline transcription levels and enhancer density may influence the tissue-specific ability of distal enhancers to overcome physical barriers and maintain faithful gene expression. Our work suggests that high affinity enhancer-promoter interactions that can overcome chromosomal structural perturbations, play an essential role in maintaining phenotypic robustness.},

Specifically, they overexpress the M2 isoform of the tightly regulated enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM2), which controls glycolytic flux, and are highly dependent on de novo biosynthesis of serine and glycine. Here we describe a new rheostat-like mechanistic relationship between PKM2 activity and serine biosynthesis. We show that serine can bind to and activate human PKM2, and that PKM2 activity in cells is reduced in response to serine deprivation. This reduction in PKM2 activity shifts cells to a fuel-efficient mode in which more pyruvate is diverted to the mitochondria and more glucose-derived carbon is channelled into serine biosynthesis to support cell proliferation.},

This could reflect the 'noise' inherent in gene expression: or the various cell states could represent stable phenotypic variants. Chang et al. analysed the behaviour of an 'outlier' in clonal populations of mouse haematoipoietic stem cells that had very high expressions of the stem cell marker Sca-1 and found that outliers possessed distinct transcriptomes. Though the transcriptomes eventually reverted back to that of the median cells, while they differed they could drive the cells to express characteristics of distinct cell fates. Thus clonal heterogeneity of gene expression may not be due to noise in the expression of individual genes, but rather is a manifestation of metastable states of a slowly fluctuating transcriptome. These fluctuations may govern the reversible, stochastic priming of multipotent progenitor cells in cell fate decision.},

Here, we show that depletion of BEAF-32, Cp190, Chro and Dref leads to changes in TAD organisation and chromatin loops. Their depletion predominantly affects TAD borders located in heterochromatin, while TAD borders located in euchromatin are resilient to these mutants. Furthermore, transcriptomic data has revealed hundreds of genes displaying differential expression in these mutants and showed that the majority of differentially expressed genes are located within reorganised TADs. Our work identifies a novel and functional role for architectural proteins at TAD borders in Drosophila and a link between TAD reorganisation and subsequent changes in gene expression.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Cancer is a disease of aberrant gene expression. While the genetic causes of cancer have been intensively studied, it is becoming evident that a large proportion of cancer susceptibility cannot be attributed to variation in protein-coding sequences. This is highlighted by genome-wide association studies in cancer that reveal that more than 80\% of cancer-associated SNPs occur in noncoding regions of the genome. In this review, we posit that a significant fraction of the genetic aetiology of cancer is exacted by noncoding regulatory sequences, particularly by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Recent studies indicate that several cancer risk loci are transcribed into lncRNAs and these transcripts play key roles in tumorigenesis. We discuss the epigenetic and other mechanisms through which lncRNAs function and how they contribute to each stage of cancer progression, understanding of which will be crucial for realising new opportunities in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Long noncoding RNAs play important roles in almost every aspect of cell biology from nuclear organisation and epigenetic regulation to post-transcriptional regulation and splicing, and we link these processes to the hallmarks and genetics of cancer. Finally, we highlight recent progress and future potential in the application of lncRNAs as therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers.},

We develop a model for integrating these data, which reveals two classes of TFs with distinct ranges of regulatory influence, chromatin-binding preferences, and auto-regulatory properties. We find that the regulatory range of the same TF bound within different topologically associating domains (TADs) depend on intrinsic TAD properties such as local gene density and G/C content, but also on the TAD chromatin states.

By examining transcriptional activation of a reporter by the endogenous even-skipped enhancers, which are located 150\,kb away, we identify three distinct topological conformation states and measure their transition kinetics. We show that sustained proximity of the enhancer to its target is required for activation. Transcription in turn affects the three-dimensional topology as it enhances the temporal stability of the proximal conformation and is associated with further spatial compaction. Furthermore, the facilitated long-range activation results in transcriptional competition at the locus, causing corresponding developmental defects. Our approach offers quantitative insight into the spatial and temporal determinants of long-range gene regulation and their implications for cellular fates.},

IF-AEF was applied in vivo to mice bearing B16F10 tumours. Terminal deoxy nucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay for apoptosis, and immunohistochemical detection of CD34 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), were performed. RESULTS: IF-AEF inhibited the proliferation of B16F10 cells in an electrical intensity and time-dependent manner. Treatment with IF-AEF for 7 days significantly inhibited the growth of tumours compared with untreated controls. IF-AEF induced apoptosis in vivo and reduced CD34-positive cell numbers; CD34 is a special marker of microvessel density. CONCLUSION: IF-AEF reduced microvessel density related to tumour growth and may serve as a therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.},

To explore its oncogenic mechanisms, we set out to identify CHD1L-regulated genes using a chromatin immunoprecipitation-based (ChIP-based) cloning strategy in a human HCC cell line. We then further characterized 1 identified gene, ARHGEF9, which encodes a specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Rho small GTPase Cdc42. Overexpression of ARHGEF9 was detected in approximately half the human HCC samples analyzed and positively correlated with CHD1L overexpression. In vitro and in vivo functional studies in mice showed that CHD1L contributed to tumor cell migration, invasion, and metastasis by increasing cell motility and inducing filopodia formation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via ARHGEF9-mediated Cdc42 activation. Silencing ARHGEF9 expression by RNAi effectively abolished the invasive and metastatic abilities of CHD1L in mice. Furthermore, investigation of clinical HCC specimens showed that CHD1L and ARHGEF9 were markedly overexpressed in metastatic HCC tissue compared with healthy tissue. Increased expression of CHD1L was often observed at the invasive front of HCC tumors and correlated with venous infiltration, microsatellite tumor nodule formation, and poor disease-free survival. These findings suggest that CHD1L-ARHGEF9-Cdc42-EMT might be a novel pathway involved in HCC progression and metastasis.},

We then expressed dCas9-p300 or dCas9-HDAC8 fusion proteins to mimic or block activity-induced histone acetylation locally at enhancers. Adding histone acetylation increased Fos transcription by prolonging burst duration and resulted in higher Fos protein levels and an elevation of resting membrane potential. Inhibiting histone acetylation reduced Fos transcription by reducing burst frequency and impaired experience-dependent Fos protein induction in the hippocampus in~vivo.

However, scRNA-seq requires lysing cells, which makes it impossible to link the individual cells to downstream molecular and phenotypic states. Here, we established Live-seq, an approach for single-cell transcriptome profiling that preserves cell viability during RNA extraction using fluidic force microscopy. Based on cell division, functional responses and whole-cell transcriptome read-outs, we show that Live-seq does not induce major cellular perturbations and therefore can function as a transcriptomic recorder. We demonstrate this recording capacity by preregistering the transcriptomes of individual macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells that were subsequently subjected to time-lapse imaging after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure. This enabled the unsupervised, genome-wide ranking of genes based on their ability to impact macrophage LPS response heterogeneity, revealing basal NFKBIA expression level and cell cycle state as major phenotypic determinants. Furthermore, we show that Live-seq can be used to sequentially profile the transcriptomes of individual macrophages before and after stimulation with LPS, thus enabling the direct mapping of a cell9s trajectory. Live-seq can address a broad range of biological questions by transforming scRNA-seq from an end-point to a temporal analysis approach.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

MGE transplantation into specific regions of the postnatal central nervous system modifies circuit function and improves deficits in mouse models of epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, pain, and phencyclidine-induced cognitive deficits. Herein, we describe approaches to generate MGE-like progenitor cells from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Using a modified embryoid body method, we provided gene expression evidence that mouse ES-derived Lhx6(+) cells closely resemble immature interneurons generated from authentic MGE-derived Lhx6(+) cells. We hypothesized that enhancers that are active in the mouse MGE would be useful tools in detecting when ES cells differentiate into MGE cells. Here we demonstrate the utility of enhancer elements [422 (DlxI12b), Lhx6, 692, 1056, and 1538] as tools to mark MGE-like cells in ES cell differentiation experiments. We found that enhancers DlxI12b, 692, and 1538 are active in Lhx6-GFP(+) cells, while enhancer 1056 is active in Olig2(+) cells. These data demonstrate unique techniques to follow and purify MGE-like derivatives from ES cells, including GABAergic cortical interneurons and oligodendrocytes, for use in stem cell-based therapeutic assays and treatments.},

In Drosophila melanogaster, genome folding is characterized by somatic homolog pairing, where homologous chromosomes are intimately paired from end to end; however, how homologs identify one another and pair has remained mysterious. Recently, this process has been proposed to be driven by specifically interacting `buttons' encoded along chromosomes. Here, we turned this hypothesis into a quantitative biophysical model to demonstrate that a button-based mechanism can lead to chromosome-wide pairing. We tested our model using live-imaging measurements of chromosomal loci tagged with the MS2 and PP7 nascent RNA labeling systems. We show solid agreement between model predictions and experiments in the pairing dynamics of individual homologous loci. Our results strongly support a button-based mechanism of somatic homolog pairing in Drosophila and provide a theoretical framework for revealing the molecular identity and regulation of buttons.},

Key to the proper inheritance of intact genome is the tight temporal and spatial coordination of cell cycle events. Moreover, checkpoints are present that function to monitor the proper execution of cell cycle processes. For instance, the DNA damage and spindle assembly checkpoints ensure genomic integrity by delaying cell cycle progression in the presence of DNA or spindle damage, respectively. A checkpoint that has recently been gaining attention is the antephase checkpoint that acts to prevent cells from entering mitosis in response to a range of stress agents. We review here what is known about the pathway that monitors the status of the cells at the brink of entry into mitosis when cells are exposed to insults that threaten the proper inheritance of chromosomes. We highlight issues which are unresolved in terms of our understanding of the antephase checkpoint and provide some perspectives on what lies ahead in the understanding of how the checkpoint functions.},

After heat shock, HAP is recruited to a few nuclear bodies. Here we report the characterisation of these bodies, which are distinct from other nuclear components such as coiled bodies and speckles. The formation of HAP bodies is part of a general cell response to stress agents, such as heat shock and cadmium sulfate, which also affect the distribution of hnRNP protein M. Electron microscopy demonstrates that in untreated cells, similar to other hnRNP proteins, HAP is associated to perichromatin fibrils. Instead, in heat shocked cells the protein is preferentially associated to clusters of perichromatin granules, which correspond to the HAP bodies observed in confocal microscopy. Inside such clusters, perichromatin granules eventually merge into a highly packaged 'core'. HAP and hnRNP M mark different districts of these structures. HAP is associated to perichromatin granules surrounding the core, while hnRNP M is mostly detected within the core. BrU incorporation experiments demonstrate that no transcription occurs within the stress-induced clusters of perichromatin granules, which are depots for RNAs synthesised both before and after heat shock.},

On the level of organs, external mechanical forces largely influence the control of tissue homeostasis by endo- and paracrine factors. On the cellular level, it is well known that most normal cell types depend on physical interactions with their extracellular matrix in order to respond efficiently to growth factors. Fibroblasts and other adherent cells sense changes in physical parameters in their extracellular matrix environment, transduce mechanical into chemical information, and integrate these signals with growth factor derived stimuli to achieve specific changes in gene expression. For connective tissue cells, production of the extracellular matrix is a prominent response to changes in mechanical load. We will review the evidence that integrin-containing cell\textendash matrix adhesion contacts are essential for force transmission from the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton, and describe novel experiments indicating that mechanotransduction in fibroblasts depends on focal adhesion adaptor proteins that might function as molecular springs. We will stress the importance of the contractile actin cytoskeleton in balancing external with internal forces, and describe new results linking force-controlled actin dynamics directly to the expression of specific genes, among them the extracellular matrix protein tenascin-C.

Putative enhancers are established by binding of the pioneer factor C/EBP{$\alpha$} followed by chromatin opening and enhancer RNA (eRNA) synthesis from H3K4-monomethylated regions. Using eRNA synthesis as a proxy for enhancer activity, we find that most putative enhancers cooperate in an additive way to regulate transcription of assigned target genes. However, transcription from 136 target genes depends exponentially on the summed activity of its putative paired enhancers, indicating that these enhancers cooperate synergistically. The target genes are cell type-specific, suggesting that enhancer synergy can contribute to cell fate determination. Enhancer synergy appears to depend on cell type-specific transcription factors, and such interacting enhancers are not predicted from occupancy or accessibility data that are used to detect superenhancers.},

  abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) are major contributors of genetic material in mammalian genomes. These often include binding sites for architectural proteins, including the multifarious master protein, CTCF. These TE-derived architectural protein binding sites shape the 3D genome by creating loops, domains, and compartments borders as well as RNA-DNA chromatin interactions, all of which play a role in the compact packaging of DNA in the nucleus and have the potential to facilitate regulatory function. In this study, we explore the widespread contribution of TEs to mammalian 3D genomes by quantifying the extent to which they give rise to loops and domain border differences across various cell types and species using a variety of 3D genome mapping technologies. We show that specific (sub-)families of TEs have significantly contributed to lineage-specific 3D chromatin structures in specific mammals. In many cases, these loops have the potential to facilitate interaction between distant cis-regulatory elements and target genes, and domains have the potential to segregate chromatin state to impact gene expression in a lineage-specific and cell-type-specific manner. Backing our extensive conformation study cataloguing and computational analyses, we perform experimental validation using CRISPR-Cas9 to delete one such candidate TE and show disruption of species-specific 3D chromatin structure. Taken together, we comprehensively quantify and selectively validate our finding that TEs contribute significantly to 3D genome organization and continuously shape it to affect gene regulation during the course of mammalian evolution over deep time.},

Flagellar biogenesis is complex, requiring coordinated expression of over 40 genes, and normally commences during the log-to-stationary transition phase. We describe here a novel membrane-localized regulator, MorA, that controls the timing of flagellar development and affects motility, chemotaxis, and biofilm formation in Pseudomonas putida. MorA is conserved among diverse Pseudomonas species, and homologues are present in all Pseudomonas genomes sequenced thus far. In P. putida, the absence of MorA derepresses flagellar development, which leads to constitutive formation of flagella in the mutant cells in all growth phases. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the absence of MorA led to a reduction in biofilm formation. However, unlike the motility of P. putida, the motility of the P. aeruginosa mutants was unaffected. Our data illustrate a novel developmentally regulated sensory and signaling pathway for several properties required for virulence and ecological fitness of Pseudomonas species.},

It is therefore unclear how long and how frequently a gene is actively transcribed, how this is modulated during differentiation, and how transcriptional events are dynamically coordinated in cell populations. By means of an in vivo RNA detection technique , we have directly visualized transcription of an endogenous developmental gene. We found discrete "pulses" of gene activity that turn on and off at irregular intervals. Surprisingly, the length and height of these pulses were consistent throughout development. However, there was strong developmental variation in the proportion of cells recruited to the expressing pool. Cells were more likely to re-express than to initiate new expression, indicating that we directly observe a transcriptional memory. In addition, we used a clustering algorithm to reveal synchronous transcription initiation in neighboring cells. This study represents the first direct visualization of transcriptional pulsing in eukaryotes. Discontinuity of transcription may allow greater flexibility in the gene-expression decisions of a cell.},

While members of the myo-bHLH family have been shown to function as transcriptional activators in differentiating muscle, the molecular basis of their function in proliferating myoblasts has not been elucidated. In this report, we present evidence that MyoD functions as a transcriptional repressor in myoblasts. We show that transcription from a cyclin B1 promoter construct is repressed in proliferating myoblasts and that repression is mediated by a pair of MyoD binding sites. We also show that transcription from the cyclin B1 promoter is repressed in proliferating C3H10T1/2 cells by ectopic expression of MyoD. These results demonstrate that MyoD can repress transcription of specific genes in proliferating cells, a novel function that may be important to maintenance of the myogenic phenotype and to cell cycle regulation in myoblasts.},

Modeling gene expression as a linear combination of quantitative protein levels revealed the genome-wide effect of each TF and recovered known targets. Cell type-specific genes associated with each TF were co-expressed as distinct modules that each corresponded to positive or negative TF levels, showing that our approach can disentangle relative contributions of TFs to gene expression and add interpretability to gene networks.

The insulator has no significant stimulatory or inhibitory effects of its own. In transgenic Drosophila, the insulator protects the white minigene from position effects.

This ability requires the proper balance between MuSC expansion and differentiation, which is critical for muscle homeostasis and contributes, if deregulated, to muscle diseases. Here, we functionally characterize a novel chromatin-associated long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), Lnc-Rewind, which is expressed in murine MuSCs and conserved in human. We find that, in mouse, Lnc-Rewind acts as an epigenetic regulator of MuSC proliferation and expansion by influencing the expression of skeletal muscle genes and several components of the WNT (Wingless-INT) signalling pathway. Among them, we identified the nearby Wnt7b gene as a direct Lnc-Rewind target. We show that Lnc-Rewind interacts with the G9a histone lysine methyltransferase and mediates the in cis repression of Wnt7b by H3K9me2 deposition. Overall, these findings provide novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of adult muscle stem cells fate by lncRNAs.},

The boundary condition for the potential between electrodes is estimated by using a linear approximation. While the Green's function used here is somewhat different from Wang et al., J. Phys. D 29, 1649 (1996), the resulting analytic expression for the potential field is in exact agreement with their result. Selected results for equispaced electrodes with equal widths are compared with Wang et al., J. Phys. D 29, 1649 (1996). The analytic solution is employed to study the effects of electrode spacing and electrode width on the gradient in electric field intensity. Results show that the magnitude in the gradient in the electric field intensity exhibited the expected dependence on the applied voltage; however, the dependence on electrode width was found to be on the order of the electrode width squared. Results to explore the effects of electrode spacing show that as the spacing is reduced below two electrode widths the magnitude of the gradient increases exponentially.},

Patients and methods Eligible patients received pemetrexed 600 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Restaging was performed after every two cycles of therapy and toxicity was assessed at each cycle of pemetrexed. In the absence of disease progression or undue toxicity, treatment was continued for a maximum of 12 cycles. Results Fifty-nine patients (median age 59 years; range 39\textendash 74 years) received a median of four cycles of pemetrexed. Nineteen patients (32\%) had a ECOG performance status (PS) of two and 39 patients (66\%) had stage IV disease. The most common histological sub-types were adenocarcinoma (20 patients, 34\%) and large cell (18 patients, 31\%). Sixteen patients (27\%) had received prior radiotherapy. Nine patients achieved a partial response for an overall response rate of 15.8\% (95\% confidence interval CI 7\% to 28\%). The median duration of response was 4.9 months, and the median survival was 7.2 months. The principal toxicities were myelosuppression and rash. While grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was seen in 25 patients (42\%), only two patients (3\%) developed grade 3 infection. Eighteen patients (31\%) developed grade 3 or 4 cutaneous toxicity, which improved with prophylactic oral dexamethasone administered for 3 days beginning the day before pemetrexed treatment. Asymptomatic elevations in hepatic biochemistry (especially alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase) were seen in 47 patients (80\%); however, these did not interfere with the dose or schedule of pemetrexed and returned to normal levels throughout the study. Conclusions This is the largest study confirming the encouraging single-agent activity of pemetrexed in chemotherapy-na\"ive patients with NSCLC. In addition, this study demonstrates that a dose of 600 mg/m2 can be delivered safely; however, treatment should be restricted to patients with a PS of 0 or 1. The results of combination studies are awaited with interest.},

Unlike overexpression of PSP1, NEAT1 overexpression increases paraspeckle number, and paraspeckles emanate exclusively from the NEAT1 transcription site. The PSP-1 RNA binding domain is required for its colocalization with NEAT1 RNA in paraspeckles, and biochemical analyses support that NEAT1 RNA binds with paraspeckle proteins. Unlike other nuclear-retained RNAs, NEAT1 RNA is not A-I edited, consistent with a structural role in paraspeckles.

However, existing CRISPR- and TALE-based genomic labeling techniques have been hampered by laborious protocols and are ineffective in labeling non-repetitive sequences. Here, we report a versatile CRISPR/Casilio-based imaging method that allows for a nonrepetitive genomic locus to be labeled using one guide RNA. We construct Casilio dual-color probes to visualize the dynamic interactions of DNA elements in single live cells in the presence or absence of the cohesin subunit RAD21. Using a three-color palette, we track the dynamic 3D locations of multiple reference points along a chromatin loop. Casilio imaging reveals intercellular heterogeneity and interallelic asynchrony in chromatin interaction dynamics, underscoring the importance of studying genome structures in 4D.},

The proliferative response is dependent on a decrease in the activity of the ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)-Cdh1 which controls G1-to-S-phase transition by targeting degradation motifs, notably the KEN box. This occurs not only in cell cycle proteins but also in the glycolysis-promoting enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase isoform 3 (PFKFB3), as we have recently demonstrated in cells in culture. We now show that APC/C-Cdh1 controls the proliferative response of human T lymphocytes. Moreover, we have found that glutaminase 1 is a substrate for this ubiquitin ligase and appears at the same time as PFKFB3 in proliferating T lymphocytes. Glutaminase 1 is the first enzyme in glutaminolysis, which converts glutamine to lactate, yielding intermediates for cell proliferation. Thus APC/C-Cdh1 is responsible for the provision not only of glucose but also of glutamine and, as such, accounts for the critical step that links the cell cycle with the metabolic substrates essential for its progression.},

Among the loci where new copies are detected, a hot spot for their insertion was identified at the white locus, where up to three elements occurred within a 3-kb fragment upstream of the transcriptional start site of white. We have used these insertions as molecular entry points to throw light on the mutagenic effect exerted by multiple insertions of retrotransposons within intergenic regions of a genome. Analysis of the molecular mechanisms by which ZAM and Idefix elements interfere with the regulation of the white gene has shown that ZAM bears cis-acting regulatory sequences able to enhance transcription of the white gene in the eyes of the flies. This activation may be counteracted by Idefix, which acts as an insulator able to isolate the white gene from the upstream ZAM enhancer. In addition to revealing a novel insulator sequence with its own specific features, our data clearly illustrate how retroelements can act as epigenetic factors able to interfere with the transcriptional regulation of their host.},

We provide in vivo evidence that retroelements may establish promoter competition with their neighboring genes and restrict the range of action of an enhancer. We report that the retroelement Idefix from Drosophila melanogaster inhibits white gene expression in testes by a promoter competition mechanism that does not occur in the eyes. The sequence specificity of the two TATA-less promoters of white and Idefix is a prime determinant in the competition that takes place in tissues where both are transcriptionally active. This study brings to light a novel mechanism whereby transcriptional interference by an active retrotransposon may perturb expression of neighboring genes. This capacity to interfere with the transcriptional regulation of their host, together with the facts that retroelements preferentially move within the germline and do not excise to replicate, suggest that these elements are cis-regulatory sequences able to imprint specific and heritable controls essential for eukaryotic gene regulation.},

The 10 mM NAAconcentration was the only concentration tested thatreduced rooting percentage to less than the control. Both NAA and IBA appeared to have broad ranges ofroot-enhancing activity. However, within theeffective range of IBA evaluated, 24.6 mM produced thegreatest rooting percentage in four of five studiestesting IBA. NAA solutions with concentrationsbetween 2.5 and 7.4 mM NAA generally resulted insimilar rooting success. Rooting responses toincreased IBA and NAA were both nonlinear; rootingdecreased with both too little and too much auxin. Combinations of IBA and NAA in the same solution didnot increase rooting percentage above what wasachieved with one auxin. For root system quality,auxin treated cuttings in one study, had significantlybetter root systems than control, but there was nodifference in the other study in which root qualitywas estimated.},

The proximal promoter is active primarily in first to early third-instar larvae, whereas the distal promoter is active in late third-instar larvae and adults. The Adh larval enhancer and the proximal promoter are separated by the Adh adult enhancer and the distal promoter. Because the proximal promoter is turned off just as the distal promoter is turned on, we considered the possibility that the distal promoter or adult enhancer has a role in the downregulation of the proximal promoter. We report here that transcription from the distal promoter is required to shut off the proximal promoter. In the absence of the distal promoter, the proximal promoter is active throughout larval development and in adults. The proximal promoter is also aberrantly active in adults when placed upstream of the distal promoter. These results suggest that the developmental switch from proximal to distal promoter is regulated by the stage-specific activation of the distal promoter, and the subsequent repression of the proximal promoter by transcriptional interference.},

It has long been suggested that this organization contributes to their steady expression across all the tissues of the organism. Here, we show that the activity of Drosophila housekeeping gene promoters depends on the expression of their neighbors. By measuring the expression of {$\sim$}85,000 reporters integrated in Kc167 cells, we identified the best predictors of expression as chromosomal contacts with the promoters and terminators of active genes. Surprisingly, the chromatin composition at the insertion site and the contacts with enhancers were less informative. These results are substantiated by the existence of genomic ``paradoxical'' domains, rich in euchromatic features and enhancers, but where the reporters are expressed at low level, concomitant with a deficit of interactions with promoters and terminators. This indicates that the proper function of housekeeping genes relies not on contacts with long distance enhancers but on spatial clustering. Overall, our results suggest that spatial proximity between genes increases their expression and that the linear architecture of the Drosophila genome contributes to this effect.},

Quantitative spatial proteomics analysis of SWIPP1019R mouse brain reveals that this mutation destabilizes the WASH complex and uncovers significant perturbations in both endosomal and lysosomal pathways. Cellular and histological analyses confirm that SWIPP1019R results in endo-lysosomal disruption and uncover indicators of neurodegeneration. We find that SWIPP1019R not only impacts cognition, but also causes significant progressive motor deficits in mice. A retrospective analysis of SWIPP1019R patients reveals similar movement deficits in humans. Combined, these findings support the model that WASH complex destabilization, resulting from SWIPP1019R, drives cognitive and motor impairments via endo-lysosomal dysfunction in the brain.},

This retrograde particle flow, occurs both over the surface of, and inside the lamellipodium. Force to drive retrograde particle flow in lamellipodia is dependent on actin filaments, but the precise mechanism of force generation, and function of the flow is generally not well understood. Actin filaments themselves, in lamellipodia of most motile cell types studied also flow retrograde relative to the substratum. This actin flow, in Aplysia bag cell neuronal growth cones, is known to be driven by activity of a myosin. In these growth cones, retrograde flow of cell surface-attached particles is coupled to retrograde actin flow. In Aplysia, force from retrograde actin flow may limit certain types of growth cone motility. In other motile cell types, such as keratocytes and fibroblasts, the mechanism of retrograde particle flow and function of retrograde actin flow in lamellipodia is poorly understood. For these cell types, recent data provide a basis for proposing alternative actin-based mechanisms to drive retrograde particle flow in lamellipodia. One mechanism is based on activity of a putative pointed end- directed actin motor, and the other on tension-driven surface lipid flow. Here I will review recent advances that have been made in determining the molecular mechanism of force generation to drive retrograde particle flow relative to the substratum in lamellipodia of motile cells. I will address the function of retrograde actin flow in lamellipodia, and apparent differences between Aplysia and other motile cell types.},

  abstract = {Back to TopAbstract We have determined the structural organization and dynamic behavior of actin filaments in entire primary locomoting heart fibroblasts by S1 decoration, serial section EM, and photoactivation of fluorescence. As expected, actin filaments in the lamellipodium of these cells have uniform polarity with barbed ends facing forward. In the lamella, cell body, and tail there are two observable types of actin filament organization. A less abundant type is located on the inner surface of the plasma membrane and is composed of short, overlapping actin bundles (0.25\textendash 2.5 {$\mu$}m) that repeatedly alternate in polarity from uniform barbed ends forward to uniform pointed ends forward. This type of organization is similar to the organization we show for actin filament bundles (stress fibers) in nonlocomoting cells (PtK2 cells) and to the known organization of muscle sarcomeres. The more abundant type of actin filament organization in locomoting heart fibroblasts is mostly ventrally located and is composed of long, overlapping bundles (average 13 {$\mu$}m, but can reach up to about 30 {$\mu$}m) which span the length of the cell. This more abundant type has a novel graded polarity organization. In each actin bundle, polarity gradually changes along the length of the bundle. Actual actin filament polarity at any given point in the bundle is determined by position in the cell; the closer to the front of the cell the more barbed ends of actin filaments face forward. By photoactivation marking in locomoting heart fibroblasts, as expected in the lamellipodium, actin filaments flow rearward with respect to substrate. In the lamella, all marked and observed actin filaments remain stationary with respect to substrate as the fibroblast locomotes. In the cell body of locomoting fibroblasts there are two dynamic populations of actin filaments: one remains stationary and the other moves forward with respect to substrate at the rate of the cell body. This is the first time that the structural organization and dynamics of actin filaments have been determined in an entire locomoting cell. The organization, dynamics, and relative abundance of graded polarity actin filament bundles have important implications for the generation of motile force during primary heart fibroblast locomotion.},

Several gene transcription factors regulate EMT, including Snail1, Snail2, Zeb1, Zeb2, and Twist; ongoing studies continue to identify and elucidate other drivers. Specific micro ribonucleic acids (RNAs) have also been found to regulate EMT, including the microRNA-200 (miR-200) family, which targets Zeb1/Zeb2. Cancer ``stem cells'' \textendash{} with the ability to self-renew and to regenerate all the cell types within the tumor \textendash{} have been found to express EMT markers, further implicating both cancer stem cells and EMT with metastasis. Microenvironmental cues, including transforming growth factor-{$\beta$}, can direct EMT tumor metastasis, such as by regulating miR-200 expression. In human tumors, EMT markers and regulators may be expressed in a subset of tumor cells, such as in cells at the invasive front or tumor\textendash microenvironment interface, though certain subtypes of cancer can show widespread mesenchymal-like features. In terms of therapeutic targeting of EMT in patients, potential areas of exploration could include targeting the cancer stem cell subpopulation, as well as microRNA-based therapeutics that reintroduce miR-200. This review will examine evidence for a role of EMT in invasion and metastasis, with the focus being on studies in lung and breast cancers. We also carry out analyses of publicly-available gene expression profiling datasets in order to show how EMT-associated genes appear coordinately expressed across human tumor specimens.},

Disentangling and characterizing the components of enhancer activity in multicellular eukaryotic development has proven challenging because enhancers contain activator and repressor binding sites for multiple factors that each exert nuanced, context-dependent control of enhancer activity. Recent advances in synthetic biology provide an almost unlimited ability to create and modify regulatory elements and networks, offering unprecedented power to study gene regulation. Here we review several studies demonstrating the utility of synthetic biology for studying enhancer function during development and evolution. These studies clearly show that synthetic biology can provide a way to reverse-engineer and reengineer transcriptional regulation in animal genomes with enormous potential for understanding evolution.},

  abstract = {Enhancers are DNA sequences that enable complex temporal and tissue-specific regulation of genes in higher eukaryotes. Although it is not entirely clear how enhancer-promoter interactions can increase gene expression, this proximity has been observed in multiple systems at multiple loci and is thought to be essential for the maintenance of gene expression. Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal domain (BET) and Mediator proteins have been shown capable of forming phase condensates and are thought to be essential for super-enhancer function. Here, we show that targeting of cells with inhibitors of BET proteins or pharmacological degradation of BET protein Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) has a strong impact on transcription but very little impact on enhancer-promoter interactions. Dissolving phase condensates reduces BRD4 and Mediator binding at enhancers and can also strongly affect gene transcription, without disrupting enhancer-promoter interactions. These results suggest that activation of transcription and maintenance of enhancer-promoter interactions are separable events. Our findings further indicate that enhancer-promoter interactions are not dependent on high levels of BRD4 and Mediator, and are likely maintained by a complex set of factors including additional activator complexes and, at some sites, CTCF and cohesin. The role of BRD4 and Mediator in regulating enhancer-promoter interactions is poorly understood. Here the authors find that treatment with BET inhibitors or pharmacological degradation of BRD4 disrupts transcription while having very little effect on enhancer-promoter interactions.},

Nevertheless, even the complete removal of cohesin has surprisingly little impact on steady-state gene transcription and enhancer activity. Here we show that cohesin is required for the core transcriptional response of primary macrophages to microbial signals, and for inducible enhancer activity that underpins inflammatory gene expression. Consistent with a role for inflammatory signals in promoting myeloid differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPSCs), cohesin mutations in HSPCs led to reduced inflammatory gene expression and increased resistance to differentiation-inducing inflammatory stimuli. These findings uncover an unexpected dependence of inducible gene expression on cohesin, link cohesin with myeloid differentiation, and may help explain the prevalence of cohesin mutations in human acute myeloid leukemia.},

Genome-wide studies utilizing STARR-seq identified two enhancer classes in Drosophila that interact with different core promoters: housekeeping enhancers (hkCP) and developmental enhancers (dCP). We hypothesized that the two enhancer classes are occupied by distinct architectural proteins, affecting their enhancer-promoter contacts. By evaluating ChIP-seq occupancy of architectural proteins, typical enhancer-associated proteins, and histone modifications, we determine that both enhancer classes are enriched for RNA Polymerase II, CBP, and architectural proteins but there are also distinctions. hkCP enhancers contain H3K4me3 and exclusively bind Cap-H2, Chromator, DREF and Z4, whereas dCP enhancers contain H3K4me1 and are more enriched for Rad21 and Fs(1)h-L. Additionally, we map the interactions of each enhancer class utilizing a Hi-C dataset with {$<$}1 kb resolution. Results suggest that hkCP enhancers are more likely to form multi-TSS interaction networks and be associated with topologically associating domain (TAD) borders, while dCP enhancers are more often bound to one or two TSSs and are enriched at chromatin loop anchors. The data support a model suggesting that the unique architectural protein occupancy within enhancers is one contributor to enhancer-promoter interaction specificity.},

They can be functionally classified as either enhancer blockers or domain barriers. CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is the only known major insulator-binding protein in the vertebrates and has been shown to bind many enhancer-blocking elements. However, it is not clear whether it plays a role in chromatin domain barriers between active and repressive domains. Here, we used ChIP-seq to map the genome-wide binding sites of CTCF in three cell types and identified significant binding of CTCF to the boundaries of repressive chromatin domains marked by H3K27me3. Although we find an extensive overlapping of CTCF-binding sites across the three cell types, its association with the domain boundaries is cell-type-specific. We further show that the nucleosomes flanking CTCF-binding sites are well positioned. Interestingly, we found a complementary pattern between the repressive H3K27me3 and the active H2AK5ac regions, which are separated by CTCF. Our data indicate that CTCF may play important roles in the barrier activity of insulators, and this study provides a resource for further investigation of the CTCF function in organizing chromatin in the human genome.},

The utilization of convergently oriented RSSs and cryptic RSSs is intrinsic to long-range RAG scanning3. Scanning of RAG from the DJH-RC-RSS to upstream convergent VH-RSSs is impeded by D-proximal CTCF-binding elements (CBEs)2\textendash 5. Primary progenitor B cells undergo a mechanistically undefined contraction of the VH locus that is proposed to provide distal VHs access to the DJH-RC6\textendash 9. Here we report that an inversion of the entire 2.4-Mb VH locus in mouse primary progenitor B cells abrogates rearrangement of both VH-RSSs and normally convergent cryptic RSSs, even though locus contraction still occurs. In addition, this inversion activated both the utilization of cryptic VH-RSSs that are normally in opposite orientation and RAG scanning beyond the VH locus through several convergent CBE domains to the telomere. Together, these findings imply that broad deregulation of CBE impediments in primary progenitor B cells promotes RAG scanning of the VH locus mediated by loop extrusion. We further found that the expression of wings apart-like protein homologue (WAPL)10, a cohesin-unloading factor, was low in primary progenitor B cells compared with v-Abl-transformed progenitor B cell lines that lacked contraction and RAG scanning of the VH locus. Correspondingly, depletion of WAPL in v-Abl-transformed lines activated both processes, further implicating loop extrusion in the locus contraction mechanism.},

The sites map to tRNA and other genes bound by the RNA polymerase III transcription factor TFIIIC, and ribosomal protein and SNR genes. An ectopic B-box element, recognized by TFIIIC, constitutes a minimal condensin-binding site, and TFIIIC and the Scc2/4 complex promote functional condensin association with chromosomes. A similar pattern of condensin binding is conserved along fission yeast chromosomes. This reveals that TFIIIC-binding sites, including tRNA genes, constitute a hitherto unknown chromosomal feature with important implications for chromosome architecture during both interphase and mitosis.},

While many factors regulate the propensity of myeloid cells to promote or repress cancerous growths, polarized adaptive immune responses by B and T lymphocytes have been identified as regulators of many aspects of myeloid cell biology by specifically regulating their functional capabilities. Here, we detail the diversity of heterogeneous B and T lymphocyte populations and their impacts on solid tumor development through their abilities to regulate myeloid cell function in solid tumors.},

After stress treatments, HAP is recruited to a small number of nuclear bodies, usually adjacent to the nucleoli, which consist of clusters of perichromatin granules and are depots of transcripts synthesized before stress. In this article we show that HAP bodies are sites of accumulation for a subset of RNA processing factors and are related to Sam68 nuclear bodies (SNBs) detectable in unstressed cells. Indeed, HAP and Sam68 are both present in SNBs and in HAP bodies, that we rename "stress-induced SNBs." The determinants required for the redistribution of HAP lie between residue 580 and 788. Different portions of this region direct the recruitment of the green fluorescent protein to stress-induced SNBs, suggesting an interaction of HAP with different components of the bodies. With the use of the 580-725 region as bait in a two-hybrid screening, we have selected SRp30c and 9G8, two members of the SR family of splicing factors. Splicing factors are differentially affected by heat shock: SRp30c and SF2/ASF are efficiently recruited to stress-induced SNBs, whereas the distribution of SC35 is not perturbed. We propose that the differential sequestration of splicing factors could affect processing of specific transcripts. Accordingly, the formation of stress-induced SNBs is accompanied by a change in the splicing pattern of the adenovirus E1A transcripts.},

While several studies have demonstrated compelling biological and disease roles for individual examples, analytical and experimental approaches to investigate these genes have been hampered by the lack of comprehensive lncRNA annotation. Here, we present and analyze the most complete human lncRNA annotation to date, produced by the GENCODE consortium within the framework of the ENCODE project and comprising 9277 manually annotated genes producing 14,880 transcripts. Our analyses indicate that lncRNAs are generated through pathways similar to that of protein-coding genes, with similar histone-modification profiles, splicing signals, and exon/intron lengths. In contrast to protein-coding genes, however, lncRNAs display a striking bias toward two-exon transcripts, they are predominantly localized in the chromatin and nucleus, and a fraction appear to be preferentially processed into small RNAs. They are under stronger selective pressure than neutrally evolving sequences\textemdash particularly in their promoter regions, which display levels of selection comparable to protein-coding genes. Importantly, about one-third seem to have arisen within the primate lineage. Comprehensive analysis of their expression in multiple human organs and brain regions shows that lncRNAs are generally lower expressed than protein-coding genes, and display more tissue-specific expression patterns, with a large fraction of tissue-specific lncRNAs expressed in the brain. Expression correlation analysis indicates that lncRNAs show particularly striking positive correlation with the expression of antisense coding genes. This GENCODE annotation represents a valuable resource for future studies of lncRNAs.},

The consequent changes in cell behavior and responsiveness result not only from genetic alterations such as activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, but also from altered production of, or responsiveness to, stimulatory or inhibitory growth and differentiation factors. Among these, transforming growth factor (TGF-) and its signaling effectors act as key determinants of carcinoma cell behavior. The autocrine and paracrine effects of TGF- on tumor cells and the tumor micro-environment exert both positive and negative influences on cancer development. Accordingly, the TGF- signaling pathway has been considered as both a tumor suppressor pathway and a promoter of tumor progression and invasion. Here we evaluate the role of TGF- in tumor development and attempt to reconcile the positive and negative effects of TGF- in carcinogenesis.},

We show here that DNA base excision repair amplifies transcriptional noise to facilitate cellular reprogramming. Specifically, the DNA repair protein Apex1, which recognizes both naturally occurring and unnatural base modifications, amplifies expression noise while homeostatically maintaining mean expression levels. This amplified expression noise originates from shorter-duration, higher-intensity transcriptional bursts generated by Apex1-mediated DNA supercoiling. The remodeling of DNA topology first impedes and then accelerates transcription to maintain mean levels. This mechanism, which we refer to as ``discordant transcription through repair'' (``DiThR,'' which is pronounced ``dither''), potentiates cellular reprogramming and differentiation. Our study reveals a potential functional role for transcriptional fluctuations mediated by DNA base modifications in embryonic development and disease.},

Here, we investigate TAD function in vivo in mouse limb buds at the Sox9-Kcnj2 locus. We show that the removal of all major CTCF sites at the boundary and within the TAD resulted in a fusion of neighboring TADs, without major effects on gene expression. Gene misexpression and disease phenotypes, however, were achieved by redirecting regulatory activity through inversions and/or the repositioning of boundaries. Thus, TAD structures provide robustness and precision but are not essential for developmental gene regulation. Aberrant disease-related gene activation is not induced by a mere loss of insulation but requires CTCF-dependent redirection of enhancer-promoter contacts.},

We use CREATE to generate AAV variants that efficiently and widely transduce the adult mouse central nervous system (CNS) after intravenous injection. One variant, AAV-PHP.B, transfers genes throughout the CNS with an efficiency that is at least 40-fold greater than that of the current standard, AAV9 (refs. 14,15,16,17), and transduces the majority of astrocytes and neurons across multiple CNS regions. In vitro, it transduces human neurons and astrocytes more efficiently than does AAV9, demonstrating the potential of CREATE to produce customized AAV vectors for biomedical applications.},

As recently reported, our data also suggest that chromatin loops preferentially form between CTCF binding sites oriented in a convergent manner. To directly test this, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to delete core CTCF binding sites in three loci, including the CTCF site in the Sox2 super-enhancer. In all instances, CTCF and cohesin recruitment were lost, and chromatin loops with distal, convergent CTCF sites were disrupted or destabilized. Re-insertion of oppositely oriented CTCF recognition sequences restored CTCF and cohesin recruitment, but did not re-establish chromatin loops. We conclude that CTCF binding polarity plays a functional role in the formation of higher-order chromatin structure.},

Gene expression has been shown to be regulated by promoter architecture and the associated chromatin environment. However, the exact contribution of these two factors in regulating expression noise has not been explored. Using a dual-reporter lentiviral model system, we deconvolved the influence of the promoter sequence to systematically study the contribution of the chromatin environment at different genomic locations in regulating expression noise. By integrating a large-scale analysis to quantify mRNA levels by smFISH and protein levels by flow cytometry in single cells, we found that mean expression and noise are uncorrelated across genomic locations. Furthermore, we showed that this independence could be explained by the orthogonal control of mean expression by the transcript burst size and noise by the burst frequency. Finally, we showed that genomic locations displaying higher expression noise are associated with more repressed chromatin, thereby indicating the contribution of the chromatin environment in regulating expression noise.},

Recent studies identified methylation of the histone H3 tail as an epigenetic mark that affects acetylation and phosphorylation of histone tail residues and also acts as a recognition signal for binding of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). The decision to silence or activate heterochromatic genes appears to be the result of a balance between negative factors that promote the formation of condensed higher-order chromatin structure, and positively acting transcription factors that bind to regulatory sequences and activate gene expression.},

Here we further describe that responsive TADs contain 20- to 100-kb-long clusters of intermingled estrogen receptor (ESR1) and progesterone receptor (PGR) binding sites, hereafter called hormone-control regions (HCRs). In T47D cells, we identified more than 200 HCRs, which are frequently bound by unliganded ESR1 and PGR. These HCRs establish steady long-distance inter-TAD interactions between them and organize characteristic looping structures with promoters in their TADs even in the absence of hormones in ESR1+-PGR+ cells. This organization is dependent on the expression of the receptors and is further dynamically modulated in response to steroid hormones. HCRs function as platforms that integrate different signals, resulting in some cases in opposite transcriptional responses to estrogens or progestins. Altogether, these results suggest that steroid hormone receptors act not only as hormone-regulated sequence-specific transcription factors but also as local and global genome organizers.},

  abstract = {The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that arise from mammary epithelial cells (MECs). One of the key early events in tumorigenic transformation is the ability of cells to overcome replicative senescence. However, the precise genetic changes that are responsible for this event in MECs is largely unknown. Here, we report that Bmi-1, originally identified as a c-Myc cooperating oncoprotein, can bypass senescence, extend the replicative life span, and immortalize MECs. Furthermore, Bmi-1 was overexpressed in immortal MECs and several breast cancer cell lines. Overexpression of Bmi-1 in MECs led to activation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) transcription and induction of telomerase activity. Telomerase induction by Bmi-1 was an early event in the extension of the replicative life span and immortalization. Bmi-1 was not overexpressed in hTERT-immortalized MECs, suggesting that Bmi-1 functions upstream of hTERT. Although, c-Myc has been reported to induce telomerase in MECs, Bmi-1 appeared to act independently of c-Myc binding sequences in the hTERT promoter. Deletion analysis of the Bmi-1 protein suggested that the RING finger, as well as a conserved helix-turn-helix-turn domain, were required for its ability to induce telomerase and immortalize MECs. These data suggest that Bmi-1 regulates telomerase expression in MECs and plays a role in the development of human breast cancer.},

Smad4 plays an important role in human physiology, and its mutations were found with high frequency in wide range of human cancer. In this study, we have functionally characterized Smad4 C324Y mutation, isolated from a nodal metastasis of papillary thyroid carcinoma. We demonstrated that the stable expression of Smad4 C324Y in FRTL-5 cells caused a significant activation of TGF{$\beta$} signaling, responsible for the acquisition of transformed phenotype and invasive behavior. The coexpression of Smad4 C324Y with Smad4 wild-type determined an increase of homo-oligomerization of Smad4 with receptor-regulated Smads and a lengthening of nuclear localization. FRTL-5 clones overexpressing Smad4 C324Y showed a strong reduction of response to antiproliferative action of TGF{$\beta$}1, acquired the ability to grow in anchorage-independent conditions, showed a fibroblast-like appearance and a strong reduction of the level of E-cadherin, one crucial event of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. The acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype gave the characteristics of increased cellular motility and a significant reduction in adhesion to substrates such as fibronectin and laminin. Overall, our results demonstrate that the Smad4 C324Y mutation plays an important role in thyroid carcinogenesis and can be considered as a new prognostic and therapeutic target for thyroid cancer.},

Sequence similarities were obtained for 20 of these fragments, and reverse transcription-PCR analysis was carried out with seven to confirm their cDNA-AFLP differential pattern. Their sequence similarities suggest a role for these genes in signal perception, transduction, and plant defense. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated that four genes involved in defense response are regulated in a similar manner by nonpathogenic bacteria, whereas one gene putatively involved in signal transduction appeared to respond more strongly to Agrobacterium. A nodulin-like gene was regulated only by Agrobacterium. These results demonstrate a rapid plant cell response to Agrobacterium infection, which overlaps a general response to bacteria but also has Agrobacterium-specific features.},

Contrary to all known bacterial phytopathogens, A. tumefaciens lacks the hypersensitive response-inducing hrp genes, although it introduces numerous proteins into the plant cell through a type IV secretion system. To understand the timing and extent of the plant transcriptional response to this unusual pathogen, we used an Arabidopsis 26,000-gene oligonucleotide microarray. We inoculated Arabidopsis cell cultures with an oncogenic Agrobacterium strain and analyzed four biological replicates to identify two robust sets of regulated genes, one induced and the other suppressed. In both cases, the response was distinct at 48 h after infection, but not at 24 h or earlier. The induced set includes genes encoding known defense proteins, and the repressed set is enriched with genes characteristic of cell proliferation even though a growth arrest was not visible in the inoculated cultures. The analysis of the repressed genes revealed that the conserved upstream regulatory elements Frankiebox (also known as "site II") and Telobox are associated with the suppression of gene expression. The regulated gene sets should be useful in dissecting the signaling pathways in this plant-pathogen interaction.},

Two papers now present a pooled approach using three levels of combinatorial indexing to examine the single-cell gene expression and chromatin landscapes from 15 organs in fetal samples. Cao et al. focus on measurements of RNA in broadly distributed cell types and provide insights into organ specificity. Domcke et al. examined the chromatin accessibility of cells from these organs and identify the regulatory elements that regulate gene expression. Together, these analyses generate comprehensive atlases of early human development. Science, this issue p. eaba7721, p. eaba7612 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONIn recent years, the single-cell genomics field has made incredible progress toward disentangling the cellular heterogeneity of human tissues. However, the overwhelming majority of effort has been focused on single-cell gene expression rather than the chromatin landscape that shapes and is shaped by gene expression. Toward advancing our understanding of the regulatory programs that underlie human cell types, we set out to generate single-cell atlases of both chromatin accessibility (this study) and gene expression (Cao et al., this issue) from a broad range of human fetal tissues. RATIONALERegions of accessible chromatin in our genome, such as enhancers, play key roles in the determination and maintenance of cell fates. Accessible regions are also markedly enriched for genetic variation that contributes to common disease heritability. The vast majority of chromatin accessibility data collected to date lacks single-cell resolution, limiting our ability to infer patterns such as which cell types are most relevant to each common disease. We previously demonstrated single-cell profiling of chromatin accessibility using combinatorial indexing, based on two rounds of in situ molecular barcoding. Here, we describe an improved assay that uses three levels of combinatorial indexing and does not rely on custom reagents. The method, sci-ATAC-seq3, reduces costs and opens the door to the scales necessary for generating a human cell atlas of chromatin accessibility. RESULTSWe applied sci-ATAC-seq3 to 59 human fetal samples ranging from 89 to 125 days in estimated postconceptual age and representing 15 organs, altogether obtaining high-quality chromatin accessibility profiles from \textasciitilde 800,000 single cells. Gene expression data collected on an overlapping set of tissues were leveraged to annotate cell types. We asked which transcription factor (TF) motifs found in the accessible sites of each cell best explain its cell type affiliation, revealing both known and potentially previously unknown regulators of cell fate specification and/or maintenance. Many TFs could be putatively assigned as activators or repressors depending on whether their expression and the accessibility of their cognate motif were positively or negatively correlated across cell types. Comparing chromatin accessibility from cell types that appear in multiple tissues revealed that whereas blood cell types are highly similar across organs, endothelial cells exhibit organ-specific chromatin accessibility, which appears to be controlled combinatorially by several TFs with overlapping expression patterns. We leveraged our master set of 1.05 million accessible sites, spanning 532 Mb or 17\% of the reference human genome, to score cell type\textendash specific links between candidate enhancers and genes based on coaccessibility, to detect cell type\textendash specific enrichment of heritability for specific common human diseases, and to identify genetic variants affecting chromatin accessibility in cis. Comparisons with chromatin accessibility in corresponding adult tissues allowed us to identify fetal-specific cell subtypes and nominate POU2F1 as a potential regulator of excitatory neuron development. CONCLUSIONSci-ATAC-seq3 adds to a growing repertoire of single-cell methods that use combinatorial indexing, a technical paradigm whose advantages include exponential scaling and greater range to profile diverse aspects of single-cell biology. We anticipate that the intersection of single-cell chromatin accessibility and gene expression will critically accelerate the field's long-term goal of establishing a deep, predictive understanding of gene regulation.

This rich resource enables, for example, identification of cell type\textendash specific regulatory elements and TFs, classification of TFs into activators and repressors, and quantification of cell type\textendash specific enrichments of complex trait heritability, as well as chromatin accessibility dynamics. The chromatin landscape underlying the specification of human cell types is of fundamental interest. We generated human cell atlases of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in fetal tissues. For chromatin accessibility, we devised a three-level combinatorial indexing assay and applied it to 53 samples representing 15 organs, profiling \textasciitilde 800,000 single cells. We leveraged cell types defined by gene expression to annotate these data and cataloged hundreds of thousands of candidate regulatory elements that exhibit cell type\textendash specific chromatin accessibility. We investigated the properties of lineage-specific transcription factors (such as POU2F1 in neurons), organ-specific specializations of broadly distributed cell types (such as blood and endothelial), and cell type\textendash specific enrichments of complex trait heritability. These data represent a rich resource for the exploration of in vivo human gene regulation in diverse tissues and cell types.

In contrast, genome-wide comparative studies of steady-state systems showed that only a small fraction of active enhancers are conserved. To better understand conservation of enhancer activity, we used a comparative genomics approach that integrates temporal expression and epigenetic profiles in an innate immune system. We found that gene expression programs diverge among mildly induced genes, while being highly conserved for strongly induced genes. The fraction of conserved enhancers varies greatly across gene expression programs, with induced genes and early-response genes, in particular, being regulated by a higher fraction of conserved enhancers. Clustering of conserved accessible DNA sequences within enhancers resulted in over 60 sequence motifs including motifs for known factors, as well as many with unknown function. We further show that the number of instances of these motifs is a strong predictor of the responsiveness of a gene to pathogen detection.},

  abstract = {The genetic and physiological similarities between mice and humans have focused considerable attention on rodents as potential models of human health and disease. Together with the wealth of resources, knowledge, and technologies surrounding the mouse as a model system, these similarities have propelled this species to the forefront of biomedical research. The advent of genomic manipulation has quickly led to the creation and use of genetically engineered mice as powerful tools for cutting edge studies of human disease research including the discovery, refinement, and utility of many currently available therapeutic regimes. In particular, the creation of genetically modified mice as models of human disease has remarkably changed our ability to understand the molecular mechanisms and cellular pathways underlying disease states. Moreover, the mouse models resulting from gene transfer technologies have been important components correlating an individual's gene expression profile to the development of disease pathologies. The objective of this review is to provide physician-scientists with an expansive historical and logistical overview of the creation of mouse models of human disease through gene transfer technologies. Our expectation is that this will facilitate on-going disease research studies and may initiate new areas of translational research leading to enhanced patient care.},

  abstract = {In motile fibroblasts, stable microtubules (MTs) are oriented toward the leading edge of cells. How these polarized MT arrays are established and maintained, and the cellular processes they control, have been the subject of many investigations. Several MT "plus-end-tracking proteins," or +TIPs, have been proposed to regulate selective MT stabilization, including the CLASPs, a complex of CLIP-170, IQGAP1, activated Cdc42 or Rac1, a complex of APC, EB1, and mDia1, and the actin-MT crosslinking factor ACF7. By using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in a wound-healing assay, we show here that CLASP2 is required for the formation of a stable, polarized MT array but that CLIP-170 and an APC-EB1 interaction are not essential. Persistent motility is also hampered in CLASP2-deficient MEFs. We find that ACF7 regulates cortical CLASP localization in HeLa cells, indicating it acts upstream of CLASP2. Fluorescence-based approaches show that GFP-CLASP2 is immobilized in a bimodal manner in regions near cell edges. Our results suggest that the regional immobilization of CLASP2 allows MT stabilization and promotes directionally persistent motility in fibroblasts.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Metazoan core promoters, which direct the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II), may contain short sequence motifs termed core promoter elements/motifs (e.g. the TATA box, initiator (Inr) and downstream core promoter element (DPE)), which recruit Pol II via the general transcription machinery. The DPE was discovered and extensively characterized in \emph{Drosophila}, where it is strictly dependent on both the presence of an Inr and the precise spacing from it. Since the \emph{Drosophila} DPE is recognized by the human transcription machinery, it is most likely that some human promoters contain a downstream element that is similar, though not necessarily identical, to the \emph{Drosophila} DPE. However, only a couple of human promoters were shown to contain a functional DPE, and attempts to computationally detect human DPE-containing promoters have mostly been unsuccessful. Using a newly-designed motif discovery strategy based on Expectation-Maximization probabilistic partitioning algorithms, we discovered preferred downstream positions (PDP) in human promoters that resemble the \emph{Drosophila} DPE. Available chromatin accessibility footprints revealed that \emph{Drosophila} and human Inr+DPE promoter classes are not only highly structured, but also similar to each other, particularly in the proximal downstream region. Clustering of the corresponding sequence motifs using a neighbor-joining algorithm strongly suggests that canonical Inr+DPE promoters could be common to metazoan species. Using reporter assays we demonstrate the contribution of the identified downstream positions to the function of multiple human promoters. Furthermore, we show that alteration of the spacing between the Inr and PDP by two nucleotides results in reduced promoter activity, suggesting a strict spacing dependency of the newly discovered human PDP on the Inr. Taken together, our strategy identified novel functional downstream positions within human core promoters, supporting the existence of DPE-like motifs in human promoters.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {It is unclear whether the core promoter is involved in developmental regulation. To address this question, we mutated the TATA box of the human gamma-globin gene, produced transgenic mice, and examined the effect of the mutation during the course of mouse development. In our test system, the gamma-globin gene is expressed at similar levels in the embryonic and adult erythroid cells. The TATA box mutation dramatically reduced expression of the gamma-globin gene in the adult but not in embryonic erythroid cells. In addition, the disruption of the gamma TATA box significantly reduced the recruitment of TATA box-binding protein (TBP) in the adult cells, but not in embryonic cells, suggesting that the recruitment of TBP to the gamma gene promoter is developmentally specific. Similarly, the recruitment of transcription factor II B and RNA polymerase II to the gamma promoter was affected in the adult but not in embryonic cells. The distinct effects of the TATA mutation in the embryonic and adult developmental stages suggest that the basal transcription apparatus can be recruited to a core promoter in a developmental stage-dependent manner. The TATA mutation resulted in a shift of transcription initiation site 6 bp or longer upstream to the cap site both in the embryonic and adult erythrocytes. We conclude that the TATA box determines the initiation site but not the efficiency of transcription of the gamma-globin gene.},

  abstract = {Background Most patients with advanced breast cancer develop bone metastases, which cause pain, hypercalcemia, fractures, nerve compression and paralysis. Chemotherapy causes further bone loss, and bone-specific treatments are only palliative. Multiple tumor-secreted factors act on the bone microenvironment to drive a feed-forward cycle of tumor growth. Effective treatment requires inhibiting upstream regulators of groups of prometastatic factors. Two central regulators are hypoxia and transforming growth factor (TGF)- {$\beta$}. We asked whether hypoxia (via HIF-1{$\alpha$}) and TGF-{$\beta$} signaling promote bone metastases independently or synergistically, and we tested molecular versus pharmacological inhibition strategies in an animal model. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed interactions between HIF-1{$\alpha$} and TGF-{$\beta$} pathways in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Only vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), of 16 genes tested, were additively increased by both TGF-{$\beta$} and hypoxia, with effects on the proximal promoters. We inhibited HIF-1{$\alpha$} and TGF-{$\beta$} pathways in tumor cells by shRNA and dominant negative receptor approaches. Inhibition of either pathway decreased bone metastasis, with no further effect of double blockade. We tested pharmacologic inhibitors of the pathways, which target both the tumor and the bone microenvironment. Unlike molecular blockade, combined drug treatment decreased bone metastases more than either alone, with effects on bone to decrease osteoclastic bone resorption and increase osteoblast activity, in addition to actions on tumor cells. Conclusions/Significance Hypoxia and TGF-{$\beta$} signaling in parallel drive tumor bone metastases and regulate a common set of tumor genes. In contrast, small molecule inhibitors, by acting on both tumor cells and the bone microenvironment, additively decrease tumor burden, while improving skeletal quality. Our studies suggest that inhibitors of HIF-1{$\alpha$} and TGF-{$\beta$} may improve treatment of bone metastases and increase survival.},

Here, we show that siRNAs corresponding to transferred-DNA oncogenes initially accumulate in virulent A. tumefaciens-infected tissues and that RNA interference-deficient plants are hypersusceptible to the pathogen. Successful infection relies on a potent antisilencing state established in tumors whereby siRNA synthesis is specifically inhibited. This inhibition has only modest side effects on the miRNA pathway, shown here to be essential for disease development. The similarities and specificities of the A. tumefaciens RNA silencing interaction are discussed and contrasted with the situation encountered with plant viruses.},

This study utilizes a recently developed reporter gene assay to test a set of Pol III-transcribed genes and gene clusters with variable promoter and intergenic regions for their ability to prevent heterochromatin-mediated reporter gene silencing in mouse cells. The results show that functional copies of mouse tRNA genes are effective barrier elements. The number of tRNA genes as well as their orientation influence barrier function. Furthermore, the DNA sequence composition of intervening and flanking regions affects barrier activity of tRNA genes. Barrier activity was maintained for much longer time when the intervening and flanking regions of tRNA genes were replaced by AT-rich sequences, suggesting a negative role of DNA methylation in the establishment of a functional barrier. Thus, our results suggest that tRNA genes are essential elements in establishment and maintenance of chromatin domain architecture in mammalian cells.},

We dissected the regulatory dynamics of hunchback by the activator Bicoid and the pioneer-like transcription factor Zelda in living Drosophila embryos and showed that no thermodynamic or non-equilibrium MWC model can recapitulate hunchback transcription. Therefore, we explored a model where DNA accessibility is not the result of thermal fluctuations but is catalyzed by Bicoid and Zelda, possibly through histone acetylation, and found that this model can predict hunchback dynamics. Thus, our theory-experiment dialogue uncovered potential molecular mechanisms of transcriptional regulatory dynamics, a key step toward reaching a predictive understanding of developmental decision-making.},

  abstract = {Position-effect variegation (PEV) results when a gene normally in euchromatin is juxtaposed with heterochromatin by rearrangement or transposition. When heterochromatin packaging spreads across the heterochromatin/euchromatin border, it causes transcriptional silencing in a stochastic pattern. PEV is intensely studied in Drosophila using the white gene. Screens for dominant mutations that suppress or enhance white variegation have identified many conserved epigenetic factors, including the histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase SU(VAR)3-9. Heterochromatin protein HP1a binds H3K9me2/3 and interacts with SU(VAR)3-9, creating a core memory system. Genetic, molecular, and biochemical analysis of PEV in Drosophila has contributed many key findings concerning establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin with concomitant gene silencing., Position-effect variegation (PEV) in Drosophila has been used to study heterochromatin formation. To date, approximately 150 genes have been connected with the onset and/or maintenance of heterochromatic gene silencing in PEV.},

Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation.

  abstract = {The core promoter compositions of mammalian protein-coding genes are highly variable; some contain TATA boxes, some contain initiator (Inr) elements, and others contain both or neither of these basal elements. The underlying reason for this heterogeneity remains a mystery, as recent studies have suggested that TATA-containing and Inr-containing core promoters direct transcription initiation by similar mechanisms and respond similarly to a wide variety of upstream activators. To analyze in greater detail the influence of core promoter structure on transcriptional activation, we compared activation by GAL4-VP16 and Sp1 through synthetic core promoters containing a TATA box, an Inr, or both TATA and Inr. Striking differences were found between the two activators, most notably in the relative strengths of the TATA/Inr and Inr core promoters: the TATA/Inr promoter was much stronger than the Inr promoter when transcription was activated by GAL4-VP16, but the strengths of the two promoters were more comparable when transcription was activated by Sp1. To define the domains of Sp1 responsible for efficient activation through an Inr, several Sp1 deletion mutants were tested as GAL4 fusion proteins. The results reveal that the glutamine-rich activation domains, which previously were found to interact with Drosophila TAF110, preferentially stimulate Inr-containing core promoters. In contrast, efficient activation through TATA appears to require additional domains of Sp1. These results demonstrate that activation domains differ in their abilities to function with specific core promoters, suggesting that the core promoter structure found in a given gene may reflect a preference of the regulators of that gene. Furthermore, the core promoter preference of an activation domain may be related to a specific mechanism of action, which may provide a functional criterion for grouping activation domains into distinct classes.},

Within this rare subpopulation, we uncover a rich substructure in which molecular differences among several distinct subpopulations predict future differences in phenotypic behavior, such as proliferative capacity of distinct resistant clones after drug treatment.

However, no role for Pbx in establishing more anterior neural compartments has been demonstrated. Studies done in Drosophila show that Engrailed requires Exd (Pbx orthologue) for its biological activity. Here, we present evidence that zebrafish Pbx proteins cooperate with Engrailed to compartmentalize the midbrain by regulating the maintenance of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) and the diencephalic-mesencephalic boundary (DMB). Embryos lacking Pbx function correctly initiate midbrain patterning, but fail to maintain eng2a, pax2a, fgf8, gbx2, and wnt1 expression at the MHB. Formation of the DMB is also defective as shown by a caudal expansion of diencephalic epha4a and pax6a expression into midbrain territory. These phenotypes are similar to the phenotype of an Engrailed loss-of-function embryo, supporting the hypothesis that Pbx and Engrailed act together on a common genetic pathway. Consistent with this model, we demonstrate that zebrafish Engrailed and Pbx interact in vitro and that this interaction is required for both the eng2a overexpression phenotype and Engrailed's role in patterning the MHB. Our data support a novel model of midbrain development in which Pbx and Engrailed proteins cooperatively pattern the mesencephalic region of the neural tube.},

The approach is especially well suited to the characterization of non-coding portions of the genome, which critically contribute to cellular phenotypes yet remain largely uncharted. Here we map nine chromatin marks across nine cell types to systematically characterize regulatory elements, their cell-type specificities and their functional interactions. Focusing on cell-type-specific patterns of promoters and enhancers, we define multicell activity profiles for chromatin state, gene expression, regulatory motif enrichment and regulator expression. We use correlations between these profiles to link enhancers to putative target genes, and predict the cell-type-specific activators and repressors that modulate them. The resulting annotations and regulatory predictions have implications for the interpretation of genome-wide association studies. Top-scoring disease single nucleotide polymorphisms are frequently positioned within enhancer elements specifically active in relevant cell types, and in some cases affect a motif instance for a predicted regulator, thus suggesting a mechanism for the association. Our study presents a general framework for deciphering cis-regulatory connections and their roles in disease.},

By comparing cis-regulatory loops in alternate cell types, we show that physical proximity does not necessarily instruct transcriptional states. Moreover, multi-way analyses reveal that multiple CRMs spatially coalesce to form hubs. Loops and CRM hubs are established early during development, before the emergence of TADs. Moreover, CRM hubs are formed, in part, via the action of the pioneer transcription factor Zelda and precede transcriptional activation. Our approach provides insight into the role of CRM\textendash promoter interactions in defining transcriptional states, as well as distinct cell types.},

In kidney cells, Wt1 recruits Cbp and p300 as coactivators; in epicardial cells it enlists Basp1 as a corepressor. Surprisingly, in both tissues, Wt1 loss reciprocally switches the chromatin architecture of the entire Ctcf-bounded Wnt4 locus, but not the flanking~regions; we term this mode of action ``chromatin flip-flop.'' Ctcf and cohesin are dispensable for Wt1-mediated chromatin flip-flop but essential for maintaining the insulating boundaries. This work demonstrates that a developmental regulator coordinates chromatin boundaries with the transcriptional competence of the flanked region. These findings also have implications for hierarchical transcriptional regulation in development and disease.},

To date, no functional domain boundaries have been defined at mammalian beta-globin loci, which are embedded within arrays of functional olfactory receptor genes. In an attempt to define boundary elements that could separate these gene clusters, CTCF-binding sites were searched for at the most distal DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HSs) of the mouse and human beta-globin loci. Conserved CTCF sites were found at 5'HS5 and 3'HS1 of both loci. All of these sites could bind to CTCF in vitro. The sites also functioned as insulators in enhancer-blocking assays at levels correlating with CTCF-binding affinity, although enhancer-blocking activity was weak with the mouse 5'HS5 site. These results show that with respect to enhancer-blocking elements, the architecture of the mouse and human beta-globin loci is similar to that found previously for the chicken beta-globin locus. Unlike the chicken locus, the mouse and human beta-globin loci do not have nearby transitions in chromatin structure but the data suggest that 3'HS1 and 5'HS5 may function as insulators that prevent inappropriate interactions between beta-globin regulatory elements and those of neighboring domains or subdomains, many of which possess strong enhancers.},

Furthermore, tumour cell heterogeneity is due in part to epigenetic variation in progenitor cells, and epigenetic plasticity together with genetic lesions drives tumour progression. This crucial early role for epigenetic alterations in cancer is in addition to epigenetic alterations that can substitute for genetic variation later in tumour progression. Therefore, non-neoplastic but epigenetically disrupted stem/progenitor cells might be a crucial target for cancer risk assessment and chemoprevention.},

  abstract = {Genetic screens are critical for the systematic identification of genes underlying cellular phenotypes. Pooling gene perturbations greatly improves scalability but is not compatible with imaging of complex and dynamic cellular phenotypes. Here, we introduce a pooled approach for optical genetic screens in mammalian cells. We use targeted in situ sequencing to demultiplex a library of genetic perturbations following image-based phenotyping. We screened a set of 952 genes across millions of cells for involvement in nuclear factor {$\kappa$}B (NF-{$\kappa$}B) signaling by imaging the translocation of RelA (p65) to the nucleus. Screening at a single time point across 3 cell lines recovered 15 known pathway components, while repeating the screen with live-cell imaging revealed a role for Mediator complex subunits in regulating the duration of p65 nuclear retention. These results establish a highly multiplexed approach to image-based screens of spatially and temporally defined phenotypes with pooled libraries.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the selective loss of nigral dopaminergic (DA) neurons, which have long axons enriched with microtubules. Depolymerization of microtubules by PD toxins such as rotenone disrupts vesicular transport. The ensuing accumulation of vesicles in the cell body leads to increased cytosolic concentration of dopamine due to leakage of the vesicles. Elevated oxidative stress induced by dopamine oxidation may thus trigger the selective demise of DA neurons. Many strategies have been developed to protect DA neurons by stabilizing microtubules either directly or through intracellular signaling cascades. On the other hand, parkin, one of the most frequently mutated genes in PD, encodes for a protein-ubiquitin E3 ligase that strongly binds to microtubules. Parkin stabilizes microtubules through three domains that provide strong and independent interactions with tubulin and microtubules. These interactions anchor parkin on microtubules and may facilitate its E3 ligase activity on misfolded proteins transported along microtubules. Thus, parkin and rotenone, two prominent genetic and environmental factors linked to PD, act in an opposing manner on the same molecular target in the cell, microtubules, whose destruction underlies the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons.},

Upon serum deprivation, a subset of AEs pre-marked by the activity-dependent neuroprotector homeobox Protein (ADNP) and located near cell-cycle genes recruits TFIIIC, which alters their chromatin accessibility by direct acetylation of histone H3 lysine-18 (H3K18). This facilitates the contacts of AEs with distant CTCF sites near promoter of other cell-cycle genes, which also become hyperacetylated at H3K18. These changes ensure basal transcription of cell-cycle genes and are critical for their re-activation upon serum re-exposure. Our study reveals how direct manipulation of the epigenetic state of AEs by a general transcription factor regulates 3D genome folding and expression.},

Cellular responses involved different genes and pathways for gene expression and splicing processes, and were also highly variable across cell types and treatments. For thousands of genes, we identified variable allelic expression across contexts, and characterized different types of gene-environment interactions. Many of these GxE genes are associated with complex traits. We characterized promoter functional and evolutionary features that distinguish genes with elevated allelic imbalance mean and variance. More than 47\% of the genes with dynamic regulatory interactions were missed by GTEx, but we identified them using a suitable allelic imbalance study design.

To our surprise, we found that double-stranded RNA was substantially more effective at producing interference than was either strand individually. After injection into adult animals, purified single strands had at most a modest effect, whereas double-stranded mixtures caused potent and specific interference. The effects of this interference were evident in both the injected animals and their progeny. Only a few molecules of injected double-stranded RNA were required per affected cell, arguing against stochiometric interference with endogenous mRNA and suggesting that there could be a catalytic or amplification component in the interference process.},

Here we report the protein coding sequence and embryonic expression pattern of the zebrafish engrailed-2 gene (eng-2) which is directly homologous to En-2 in mice and Xenopus. The predicted zebrafish Eng-2 protein shares 65\% overall identity to its Xenopus counterpart. In addition to the highly conserved homeodomain region, sequence conservation is present within three short stretches in the N-terminal region. The embryonic expression of the eng-2 gene was analysed by in situ hybridization to whole-mount embryos and tissue sections. Transcripts are first detected in two lateral bands at the 10-h stage, when epiboly is completed. Within the next 2 h of development, these two bands migrate and fuse at the midline. By the time the neural keel becomes visible (11\textendash 12 h), a transverse stripe of eng-2 expressing cells is seen at the presumptive midbrain-hinbrain boundary. Later this stripe becomes significantly compressed along the AP axis, and in 24-h embryos eng-2 transcripts are detected mainly in the posterior midbrain. In the hindbrain, eng-2 expression seems restricted to the primordium of the cerebellum. A second site of activity was observed in each somite where specific myotomal cells, the muscle pioneers, express eng-2. Our observations are discussed in relation to early regionalization of the central nervous system (CNS) and the generation of morphological borders.},

How DNA mutations affecting any one of these regulatory `layers' is buffered or propagated to gene expression remains unclear. To address this, we quantified allele-specific changes in chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and gene expression in F1 embryos generated from eight \emph{Drosophila} crosses, at three embryonic stages, yielding a comprehensive dataset of 240 samples spanning multiple regulatory layers. Genetic variation in \emph{cis}-regulatory elements is common, highly heritable, and surprisingly consistent in its effects across embryonic stages. Much of this variation does not propagate to gene expression. When it does, it acts through H3K4me3 or alternatively through chromatin accessibility and H3K27ac. The magnitude and evolutionary impact of mutations is influenced by a genes' regulatory complexity (\emph{i}.\emph{e}. enhancer number), with transcription factors being most robust to \emph{cis}-acting, and most influenced by \emph{trans}-acting, variation. Overall, the impact of genetic variation on regulatory phenotypes appears context-dependent even within the constraints of embryogenesis.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The origin of organismal complexity is generally thought to be tightly coupled to the evolution of new gene functions arising subsequent to gene duplication. Under the classical model for the evolution of duplicate genes, one member of the duplicated pair usually degenerates within a few million years by accumulating deleterious mutations, while the other duplicate retains the original function. This model further predicts that on rare occasions, one duplicate may acquire a new adaptive function, resulting in the preservation of both members of the pair, one with the new function and the other retaining the old. However, empirical data suggest that a much greater proportion of gene duplicates is preserved than predicted by the classical model. Here we present a new conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of duplicate genes that may help explain this conundrum. Focusing on the regulatory complexity of eukaryotic genes, we show how complementary degenerative mutations in different regulatory elements of duplicated genes can facilitate the preservation of both duplicates, thereby increasing long-term opportunities for the evolution of new gene functions. The duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) model predicts that (1) degenerative mutations in regulatory elements can increase rather than reduce the probability of duplicate gene preservation and (2) the usual mechanism of duplicate gene preservation is the partitioning of ancestral functions rather than the evolution of new functions. We present several examples (including analysis of a new engrailed gene in zebrafish) that appear to be consistent with the DDC model, and we suggest several analytical and experimental approaches for determining whether the complementary loss of gene subfunctions or the acquisition of novel functions are likely to be the primary mechanisms for the preservation of gene duplicates. For a newly duplicated paralog, survival depends on the outcome of the race between entropic decay and chance acquisition of an advantageous regulatory mutation. Sidow 1996(p. 717) On one hand, it may fix an advantageous allele giving it a slightly different, and selectable, function from its original copy. This initial fixation provides substantial protection against future fixation of null mutations, allowing additional mutations to accumulate that refine functional differentiation. Alternatively, a duplicate locus can instead first fix a null allele, becoming a pseudogene. Walsh 1995 (p. 426) Duplicated genes persist only if mutations create new and essential protein functions, an event that is predicted to occur rarely. Nadeau and Sankoff 1997 (p. 1259) Thus overall, with complex metazoans, the major mechanism for retention of ancient gene duplicates would appear to have been the acquisition of novel expression sites for developmental genes, with its accompanying opportunity for new gene roles underlying the progressive extension of development itself.

  abstract = {Gene expression variability in mammalian systems plays an important role in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. This variability can come from differential regulation related to cell state (extrinsic) and allele-specific transcriptional bursting (intrinsic). Yet, the relative contribution of these two distinct sources is unknown. Here, we exploit the qualitative difference in the patterns of covariance between these two sources to quantify their relative contributions to expression variance in mammalian cells. Using multiplexed error robust RNA fluorescent in~situ hybridization (MERFISH), we measured the multivariate gene expression distribution of 150 genes related to Ca2+ signaling coupled with the dynamic Ca2+ response of live cells to ATP. We show that after controlling for cellular phenotypic states such as size, cell cycle stage, and Ca2+ response to ATP, the remaining variability is effectively at the Poisson limit for most genes. These findings demonstrate that the majority of expression variability results from cell state differences and that the contribution of transcriptional bursting is relatively minimal., Single-cell coupled measurements of Ca2+ signaling dynamics, cell size, cell cycle, and expression of Ca2+ signaling-related genes show that most of the gene expression variability is not gene-specific. The remaining gene-specific variability approaches Poisson limit for most genes.},

  abstract = {The capacity of doxorubicin to inhibit topoisomerase II in the MCF-7 breast tumor cell line is supported by the induction of protein-associated single-strand breaks in DNA, as well as by interference with the decatenation activity of nuclear extracts. Doxorubicin also produces non-protein-associated DNA strand breaks (at a supraclinical concentration of 5 microM), which may indicate damage mediated via the generation of free radicals. However, no strand breaks are detected in DNA of MCF-7 cells at the IC50 for doxorubicin (approximately 0.1 microM). At doxorubicin concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 microM, at which growth is inhibited by approximately 15, 50, and 75\%, respectively, doxorubicin interferes with radiation-induced unwinding of DNA; doxorubicin also produces a concentration-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis that corresponds closely to growth inhibition. These studies suggest that DNA strand breaks fail to fully account for the antiproliferative activity of doxorubicin in the MCF-7 breast tumor cell line. Compromised DNA synthesis associated with interference with DNA unwinding may contribute to growth inhibition in MCF-7 cells exposed to doxorubicin.},

  abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma is the sixth most prevalent cancer and the third most frequent cause of cancer-related death. Patients with cirrhosis are at highest risk of developing this malignant disease, and ultrasonography every 6 months is recommended. Surveillance with ultrasonography allows diagnosis at early stages when the tumour might be curable by resection, liver transplantation, or ablation, and 5-year survival higher than 50\% can be achieved. Patients with small solitary tumours and very well preserved liver function are the best candidates for surgical resection. Liver transplantation is most beneficial for individuals who are not good candidates for resection, especially those within Milano criteria (solitary tumour {$\leq$}5 cm and up to three nodules {$\leq$}3 cm). Donor shortage greatly limits its applicability. Percutaneous ablation is the most frequently used treatment but its effectiveness is limited by tumour size and localisation. In asymptomatic patients with multifocal disease without vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread not amenable to curative treatments, chemoembolisation can provide survival benefit. Findings of randomised trials of sorafenib have shown survival benefits for individuals with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting that molecular-targeted therapies could be effective in this chemoresistant cancer.

  abstract = {Keratins 8 and 18 (K8/18) are simple epithelial-specific intermediate filament proteins. Keratins are essential for tissues integrity and are involved in intracellular signaling pathways which regulate cell response to injuries, cell growth and death. K8/18 expression are maintained during tumorigenesis, hence their use as diagnostic marker in tumor pathology. In recent years, studies provided evidence that keratins should not be considered only as markers but also as regulators of cancer cell signaling. The loss of K8/18 expression during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with metastasis and chemoresistance. In the present study, we investigated whether K8/18 expression play an active role in EMT. We show that K8/18 stable knockdown using shRNA increases collective migration and invasiveness of epithelial cancer cells without modulating EMT markers. K8/18-depleted cells show PI3K/Akt/NF-{$\kappa$}B hyperactivation and increased MMP2 and MMP9 expression. K8/18 deletion also increases cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Increased FasR membrane targeting suggest that apoptosis is enhanced via the extrinsic pathway. Interestingly, we identified the tight junction protein claudin1 as a regulator of these processes. This is the first indication that modulation of K8/18 expression can influence the phenotype of epithelial cancer cells at a transcriptional level and support the hypothesis that keratins play an active role in cancer progression.},

Here we show that yeast subtelomeric anti-silencing regions behave as boundaries to telomere-driven silencing and also allow discontinuous propagation of silent chromatin. These two facets of insulator activity, boundary and silencing discontinuity, can be recapitulated by tethering various transcription activation domains to tandem sites on DNA. Importantly, we show that these insulator activities do not involve direct transcriptional activation of the reporter promoter. These findings predict that certain promoters behave as insulators and partition genomes in functionally independent domains.},

We have investigated the influence of these sequences on telomeric silencing. The telomere-proximal portion of either X or Y' dampened silencing when located between the telomere and the reporter gene. These elements were named STARs, for subtelomeric anti-silencing regions. STARs can also counteract silencer-driven repression at the mating-type HML locus. When two STARs bracket a reporter gene, its expression is no longer influenced by surrounding silencing elements, although these are still active on a second reporter gene. In addition, an intervening STAR uncouples the silencing of neighboring genes. STARs thus display the hallmarks of insulators. Protection from silencing is recapitulated by multimerized oligonucleotides representing Tbf1p- and Reb1p-binding sites, as found in STARs. In contrast, sequences located more centromere proximal in X and Y' elements reinforce silencing. They can promote silencing downstream of an insulated expressed domain. Overall, our results suggest that the silencing emanating from telomeres can be propagated in a discontinuous manner via a series of subtelomeric relay elements.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cell nucleus contains distinct classes of subnuclear bodies, including nucleoli, splicing speckles, Cajal bodies, gems, and PML bodies. Many nuclear proteins are known to interact dynamically with one or other of these bodies, and disruption of the specific organization of nuclear proteins can result in defects in cell functions and may cause molecular disease. RESULTS: A proteomic study of purified human nucleoli has identified novel proteins, including Paraspeckle Protein 1 (PSP1) (see accompanying article, this issue of Current Biology). Here we show that PSP1 accumulates in a new nucleoplasmic compartment, termed paraspeckles, that also contains at least two other protein components: PSP2 and p54/nrb. A similar pattern of typically 10 to 20 paraspeckles was detected in all human cell types analyzed, including primary and transformed cells. Paraspeckles correspond to discrete bodies in the interchromatin nucleoplasmic space that are often located adjacent to splicing speckles. A stable cell line expressing YFP-PSP1 has been established and used to demonstrate that PSP1 interacts dynamically with nucleoli and paraspeckles in living cells. The three paraspeckle proteins relocalize quantitatively to unique cap structures at the nucleolar periphery when transcription is inhibited. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a novel nuclear compartment, termed paraspeckles, found in both primary and transformed human cells. Paraspeckles contain at least three RNA binding proteins that all interact dynamically with the nucleolus in a transcription-dependent fashion.},

Here, we show that the intermittent access of the promoters to transcription factors through relatively impervious chromatin contributes to this ``noisy'' transcription. We tethered a nuclease-deficient Cas9 fused to a histone acetyl transferase at the promoters of two endogenous genes in HeLa cells. An assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing showed that the activity of the histone acetyl transferase altered the chromatin architecture locally without introducing global changes in the nucleus and rendered the targeted promoters constitutively accessible. We measured the gene expression variability from the gene loci by performing single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization against mature messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and by imaging nascent mRNA molecules present at active gene loci in single cells. Because of the increased accessibility of the promoter to transcription factors, the transcription from two genes became less noisy, even when the average levels of expression did not change. In addition to providing evidence for chromatin accessibility as a determinant of the noise in gene expression, our study offers a mechanism for controlling gene expression noise which is otherwise unavoidable.},

  abstract = {The effect of dose and dose rate of cancer chemotherapeutic agents in experimental in vivo systems and in various clinical situations has been reviewed. In experimental in vivo systems, the dose-response curve for most chemotherapeutic agents is steep. Although the dose response curve may be linear for cytokinetically homogeneous experimental tumors, it deviates from linearity as a result of tumor heterogeneity. The steepness of the dose-response curve is related to the sensitivity of the tumor to a given drug. Thus, for highly sensitive tumors, the curve is very steep and generally linear; whereas for relatively insensitive tumors, dose may have little effect on response. These observations in general apply to the clinic. When dose has been a randomized variable, a dose-response curve is generally evident in sensitive tumors, such as the leukemias, the lymphomas, testicular cancer and small cell lung cancer. In contrast, when the difference in dose is in the range of twofold, the evidence for superiority of the high dose in such situations as 5-fluorouracil for colorectal cancer and dimethyl-triazeno-imidazole-car{$\Square$}amide (DTIC) for melanoma is less impressive. The use of relatively low dose maintenance treatment following four to six courses of intensive combination chemotherapy for such diseases as testicular cancer and lymphoma may prolong the duration of remission but probably will not increase the cure rate. In adjuvant chemotherapy situations, in which prolonged disease-free survival is improved, the dose-response curve would appear to be quite steep. Conservative dosing in this setting may compromise the cure rate, and the proposed approach is to maintain full dose therapy and consider reducing the total duration of treatment. When high doses or concentrations of antitumor therapy can be achieved, such as in the marrow transplant situation and in isolation perfusion or regional infusion studies, there is in general clear evidence that a substantial increase in response rate occurs.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty-seven patients were randomly assigned to receive bevacizumab 10 mg/kg alone or in combination with irinotecan 340 mg/m(2) or 125 mg/m(2) (with or without concomitant enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs, respectively) once every 2 weeks. Primary end points were 6-month progression-free survival and objective response rate, as determined by independent radiology review. Secondary end points included safety and overall survival. RESULTS: In the bevacizumab-alone and the bevacizumab-plus-irinotecan groups, estimated 6-month progression-free survival rates were 42.6\% and 50.3\%, respectively; objective response rates were 28.2\% and 37.8\%, respectively; and median overall survival times were 9.2 months and 8.7 months, respectively. There was a trend for patients who were taking corticosteroids at baseline to take stable or decreasing doses over time. Of the patients treated with bevacizumab alone or bevacizumab plus irinotecan, 46.4\% and 65.8\%, respectively, experienced grade {$>$} or = 3 adverse events, the most common of which were hypertension (8.3\%) and convulsion (6.0\%) in the bevacizumab-alone group and convulsion (13.9\%), neutropenia (8.9\%), and fatigue (8.9\%) in the bevacizumab-plus-irinotecan group. Intracranial hemorrhage was noted in two patients (2.4\%) in the bevacizumab-alone group (grade 1) and in three patients (3.8\%) patients in the bevacizumab-plus-irinotecan group (grades 1, 2, and 4, respectively). CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab, alone or in combination with irinotecan, was well tolerated and active in recurrent glioblastoma.},

We show that initiation events are clustered on the chromosomes at multiple scales\textemdash clusters within clusters\textemdash indicating multiple regulatory processes. Within the smallest of such clusters, which can be interpreted as core promoters, the local DNA sequence predicts the relative transcription start usage of each nucleotide with a remarkable 91\% accuracy, implying the existence of a DNA code that determines TSS selection. Conversely, the total expression strength of such clusters is only partially determined by the local DNA sequence. Thus, the overall control of transcription can be understood as a combination of large- and small-scale effects; the selection of transcription start sites is largely governed by the local DNA sequence, whereas the transcriptional activity of a locus is regulated at a different level; it is affected by distal features or events such as enhancers and chromatin remodeling.},

  abstract = {Abstract Cellular decision-making and environmental adaptation are dependent upon a heterogeneous response of gene expression to external cues. Heterogeneity arises in transcription from random switching between transcriptionally active and inactive states, resulting in bursts of RNA synthesis. Furthermore, the cellular state influences the competency of transcription, thereby globally affecting gene expression in a cell-specific manner. We determined how external stimuli interplay with cellular state to modulate the kinetics of bursting. To this end, single-cell dynamics of nascent transcripts were monitored at the endogenous estrogen-responsive GREB1 locus. Stochastic modeling of gene expression implicated a two-state promoter model in which the estrogen stimulus modulates the frequency of transcriptional bursting. The cellular state affects transcriptional dynamics by altering initiation and elongation kinetics and acts globally, as GREB1 alleles in the same cell correlate in their transcriptional output. Our results suggest that cellular state strongly affects the first step of the central dogma of gene expression, to promote heterogeneity in the transcriptional output of isogenic cells.},

Killing of tumor cells by most anticancer strategies currently used in clinical oncology, for example, chemotherapy, gamma-irradiation, suicide gene therapy or immunotherapy, has been linked to activation of apoptosis signal transduction pathways in cancer cells such as the intrinsic and/or extrinsic pathway. Thus, failure to undergo apoptosis may result in treatment resistance.

EMT cells also acquire stem cell characteristics suggesting crosstalk between EMT and stem cell pathways and contribution of the EMT process to the generation of cancer stem cells. Indeed, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-{$\beta$}), a major inducer of EMT, cooperates with stem cell pathways like Wnt, Ras, Hedgehog and Notch to induce EMT. A molecular basis for this cooperative signaling is indicated by recent data showing that many EMT associated transcription factors like Snail1, Zeb1/2, Twist, {$\beta$}-catenin, Lef/TCF, Foxc2 and AP-1 interact with Smads and form EMT promoting Smad complexes (EPSC) engaged in both repressing epithelial genes and activating mesenchymal genes. Thus, formation and activation of EPSC seems to represent a point of convergence between EMT and stem cell pathways. Here, we review our current understanding of the mechanisms involved in the transcriptional crosstalk between TGF-{$\beta$} and stem cell pathways and discuss how a fundament for the activation of these mechanisms may lead to the induction of EMT in tumors.},

High levels of PLT activity promote stem cell identity and maintenance; lower levels promote mitotic activity of stem cell daughters; and further reduction in levels is required for cell differentiation. Our findings indicate that PLT protein dosage is translated into distinct cellular responses.},

Although this phosphotransferase reaction is critical in mediating TGF-beta stimulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion in mammary epithelial cells (MECs), the necessity of Grb2 in promoting these TGF-beta-dependent events remain purely correlative. Herein, we further evaluated the role of Grb2 in mediating the oncogenic activities of TGF-beta and show that the binding of Grb2 to TbetaR-II paralleled the induction of EMT in MECs stimulated by TGF-beta. Introducing siRNAs against Grb2 or expression of a TbetaR-II mutant that cannot bind Grb2 (i.e. Y284F-TbetaR-II) had no effect on the ability of TGF-beta to activate Smad3, but significantly impaired its stimulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in MECs. Importantly, these same cellular conditions also prevented the ability of MECs to undergo EMT in response to TGF-beta, and to invade synthetic basement membranes when stimulated by beta3 integrin and TGF-beta. Finally, we show that the ability of TGF-beta to stimulate breast cancer growth and pulmonary metastasis in mice required TbetaR-II to be phosphorylated on Tyr284, which activated p38 MAPK in developing and progressing mammary tumors. Collectively, our findings have established the necessity of Grb2 in mediating TGF-beta stimulation of EMT and invasion in MECs, as well as demonstrated the essential function of the alphavbeta3 integrin:Src:phospho-Y284-TbetaR-II:Grb2:p38 MAPK signaling axis to promote breast cancer growth and metastasis in vivo.},

To evaluate the potential genotoxicity of piggyBac, we compared 228 integration sites in primary human T cells to integrations in two other human derived cell lines (HEK293 and HeLa) and randomly simulated integrations into the human genome. Our results revealed distinct differences between cell types. PiggyBac had a non-random integration profile and a preference for transcriptional units (\textasciitilde 50\% into RefSeq genes in all cell types), CpG islands (18\% in T cells and 8\% in other human cells), and transcriptional start sites (TSS) ({$<$} 5kb, 16\textendash 20\% in all cell types). PiggyBac also preferred TTAA but not AT rich regions of the human genome. We evaluated the expression of mapped genes into which piggyBac integrated, and found selection of more active genes in primary human T cells compared to other human cell types, possibly due to concomitant T cell activation during transposition. Importantly, we found that in comparison to what has been reported for gammaretroviral and human lenitviral vectors, piggyBac had decreased integration frequency into or within 50kb of the TSS of known proto-oncogenes. Hence the piggyBac non-viral gene delivery system appears to represent a promising gene transfer system for clinical applications using human T lymphocytes.},

Our results revealed that transcript levels of temporally induced genes are highly correlated in individual cells.

These findings support a polymer model of HP1{$\alpha$}-mediated chromatin regulation and highlight the utility of CRISPR-EChO in studying supranucleosomal chromatin organization in living cells.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Analysis of endogenous protein localization, function, and dynamics is fundamental to the study of all cells, including the diversity of cell types in the brain. However, current approaches are often low throughput and resource intensive. Here, we describe a CRISPR-Cas9-based homology-independent universal genome engineering (HiUGE) method for endogenous protein manipulation that is straightforward, scalable, and highly flexible in terms of genomic target and application. HiUGE employs adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors of autonomous insertional sequences (payloads) encoding diverse functional modifications that can integrate into virtually any genomic target loci specified by easily assembled gene-specific guide-RNA (GS-gRNA) vectors. We demonstrate that universal HiUGE donors enable rapid alterations of proteins in vitro or in vivo for protein labeling and dynamic visualization, neural-circuit-specific protein modification, subcellular rerouting and sequestration, and truncation-based structure-function analysis. Thus, the ``plug-and-play'' nature of HiUGE enables high-throughput and modular analysis of mechanisms driving protein functions in cellular neurobiology.},

Several classes of hormones have been reported, and their activity depends on their biosynthesis, transport, conjugation, accumulation in the vacuole, and degradation. However, the activity of a given hormone is also dependent on its interaction with other hormones. Indeed, there is a complex crosstalk between hormones that regulates their biosynthesis, transport, and/or signaling functionality, although some hormones have overlapping or opposite functions. The plant root is a particularly useful system in which to study the complex role of plant hormones in the plastic control of plant development. Physiological, cellular, and molecular genetic approaches have been used to study the role of plant hormones in root meristem homeostasis. In this review, we discuss recent findings on the synthesis, signaling, transport of hormones and role during root development and examine the role of hormone crosstalk in maintaining homeostasis in the apical root meristem.},

  abstract = {Although vertebrate DNA is generally depleted in the dinucleotide CpG, it has recently been shown that some vertebrate genes contain CpG islands, regions of DNA with a high G + C content and a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides relative to the bulk genome. In this study, a large number of sequences of vertebrate genes were screened for the presence of CpG islands. Each CpG island was then analysed in terms of length, nucleotide composition, frequency of CpG dinucleotides, and location relative to the transcription unit of the associated gene. CpG islands were associated with the 5{${'}$} ends of all housekeeping genes and many tissue-specific genes, and with the 3{${'}$} ends of some tissue-specific genes. A few genes contained both 5{${'}$} and 3{${'}$} CpG islands, separated by several thousand base-pairs of CpG-depleted DNA. The 5{${'}$} CpG islands extended through 5{${'}$}-flanking DNA, exons and introns, whereas most of the 3{${'}$} CpG islands appeared to be associated with exons. CpG islands were generally found in the same position relative to the transcription unit of equivalent genes in different species, with some notable exceptions. The locations of GC boxes, composed of the sequence GGGCGG or its reverse complement CCGCCC, were investigated relative to the location of CpG islands. GC boxes were found to be rare in CpG-depleted DNA and plentiful in CpG islands, where they occurred in 3{${'}$} CpG islands, as well as in 5{${'}$} CpG islands associated with tissue-specific and housekeeping genes. GC boxes were located both upstream and downstream from the transcription start site of genes with 5{${'}$} CpG islands. Thus, GC boxes appeared to be a feature of CpG islands in general, rather than a feature of the promoter region of housekeeping genes. Two theories for the maintenance of a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides in CpG islands were tested: that CpG islands in methylated genomes are maintained, despite a tendency for 5mCpG to mutate by deamination to TpG + CpA, by the structural stability of a high G + C content alone, and that CpG islands associated with exons result from some selective importance of the arginine codon CGX. Neither of these theories could account for the distribution of CpG dinucleotides in the sequences analysed. Possible functions of CpG islands in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression were discussed, and were related to theories for the maintenance of CpG islands as ``methylationfree zones'' in germline DNA.},

The TdT promoter lacks a TATA box, but an initiator element (Inr) overlaps the transcription start site. The Inr directs basal transcription and also mediates activated transcription in conjunction with an upstream element called D'. We have begun to address the fundamental question of why the TdT promoter contains an Inr rather than a TATA box. First, we tested the possibility that the TdT promoter lacks a TATA box because the -30 region is needed for the binding of an essential regulator. Mutations were introduced into the -30 region, and the mutants were tested in transient transfection and in vitro transcription assays. The mutations had only minor effects on promoter strength, suggesting that this first hypothesis is incorrect. Next, the effect of inserting a TATA box within the -30 region was tested. Although the TATA box enhanced promoter strength, appropriate regulation appeared to be maintained, as transcription in lymphocytes remained dependent on the D' element. Finally, a promoter variant containing a TATA box at -30, but a mutant Inr, was tested. Surprisingly, transcription from this variant, both in vitro and in vivo, was dramatically reduced. These results suggest that the TdT promoter, and possibly other natural promoters, contain an Inr element because one or more activator proteins that interact with surrounding control elements preferentially function in its presence.},

Across two experiments, we used dCas9-KRAB to perturb 5,920 candidate enhancers with no strong a~priori hypothesis as to their target gene(s), measuring effects by profiling 254,974 single-cell~transcriptomes. We identified 664 (470 high-confidence) cis enhancer-gene pairs, which were enriched for specific transcription factors, non-housekeeping status, and genomic and 3D conformational proximity to their target genes. This framework will facilitate the large-scale mapping of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions, a critical yet largely uncharted component of the cis-regulatory landscape of the human genome.},

Since the initial reports in the early 1980s using Agrobacterium to generate transgenic plants, scientists have attempted to improve this ``natural genetic engineer'' for biotechnology purposes. Some of these modifications have resulted in extending the host range of the bacterium to economically important crop species. However, in most instances, major improvements involved alterations in plant tissue culture transformation and regeneration conditions rather than manipulation of bacterial or host genes. Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation is a highly complex and evolved process involving genetic determinants of both the bacterium and the host plant cell. In this article, I review some of the basic biology concerned with Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. Knowledge of fundamental biological principles embracing both the host and the pathogen have been and will continue to be key to extending the utility of Agrobacterium for genetic engineering purposes.},

This observation can be reproduced by inserting just a 430-bp fragment containing the suppressor of Hairy-wing [su(Hw)]-binding region of gypsy into the same position where this element is inserted in y2, suggesting that the su(Hw)-binding region is sufficient to confer the mutant phenotype. Insertion of this sequence into various positions in the y gene gives rise to phenotypes that can be rationalized assuming that the presence of the su(Hw) protein inhibits the action of those tissue-specific enhancers that are located more distally from the su(Hw)-binding region with respect to the promoter.

  abstract = {Oligomers of length k, or k-mers, are convenient and widely used features for modeling the properties and functions of DNA and protein sequences. However, k-mers suffer from the inherent limitation that if the parameter k is increased to resolve longer features, the probability of observing any specific k-mer becomes very small, and k-mer counts approach a binary variable, with most k-mers absent and a few present once. Thus, any statistical learning approach using k-mers as features becomes susceptible to noisy training set k-mer frequencies once k becomes large. To address this problem, we introduce alternative feature sets using gapped k-mers, a new classifier, gkm-SVM, and a general method for robust estimation of k-mer frequencies. To make the method applicable to large-scale genome wide applications, we develop an efficient tree data structure for computing the kernel matrix. We show that compared to our original kmer-SVM and alternative approaches, our gkm-SVM predicts functional genomic regulatory elements and tissue specific enhancers with significantly improved accuracy, increasing the precision by up to a factor of two. We then show that gkm-SVM consistently outperforms kmer-SVM on human ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets, and further demonstrate the general utility of our method using a Na\"ive-Bayes classifier. Although developed for regulatory sequence analysis, these methods can be applied to any sequence classification problem.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Developmental genes such as Xist, the master regulator of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), are controlled by complex cis-regulatory landscapes, which decode multiple signals to establish specific spatio-temporal expression patterns. Xist integrates information on X-chromosomal dosage and developmental stage to trigger XCI at the primed pluripotent state in females only. Through a pooled CRISPR interference screen in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, we identify functional enhancer elements of Xist during the onset of random XCI. By quantifying how enhancer activity is modulated by X-dosage and differentiation, we find that X-dosage controls the promoter-proximal region in a binary switch-like manner. By contrast, differentiation cues activate a series of distal elements and bring them into closer spatial proximity of the Xist promoter. The strongest distal element is part of an enhancer cluster \textasciitilde 200 kb upstream of the Xist gene which is associated with a previously unannotated Xist-enhancing regulatory transcript, we named Xert. Developmental cues and X-dosage are thus decoded by distinct regulatory regions, which cooperate to ensure female-specific Xist upregulation at the correct developmental time. Our study is the first step to disentangle how multiple, functionally distinct regulatory regions interact to generate complex expression patterns in mammals.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

EMT is regulated by both biochemical and physical signals from the microenvironment, including mechanical stress, which is increasingly recognized to play a major role in development and disease progression. Biological systems generate, transmit and concentrate mechanical stress into spatial patterns; these gradients in mechanical stress may serve to spatially pattern developmental and pathologic EMTs. Here we review how epithelial tissues generate and respond to mechanical stress gradients, and highlight the mechanisms by which mechanical stress regulates and patterns EMT.},

We discovered evidence of lineage-specific selection on the hedgehog signaling pathway, including a human-specific sixfold down-regulation of EVC2 (LIMBIN), a key hedgehog gene. Inducing a similar down-regulation of EVC2 substantially reduced hedgehog signaling output. Mice and humans lacking functional EVC2 show striking phenotypic parallels to human\textendash chimpanzee craniofacial differences, suggesting that the regulatory divergence of hedgehog signaling may have contributed to the unique craniofacial morphology of humans.},

In prokaryotes, the contribution to such fluctuations from the inherent randomness of gene expression has largely been attributed to having just a few transcripts of the corresponding mRNAs. By contrast, eukaryotic studies tend to emphasize chromatin remodeling and burst-like transcription. Here, we study single-cell transcription in Escherichia coli by measuring mRNA levels in individual living cells. The results directly demonstrate transcriptional bursting, similar to that indirectly inferred for eukaryotes. We also measure mRNA partitioning at cell division and correlate mRNA and protein levels in single cells. Partitioning is approximately binomial, and mRNA-protein correlations are weaker earlier in the cell cycle, where cell division has recently randomized the relative concentrations. Our methods further extend protein-based approaches by counting the integer-valued number of transcript with single-molecule resolution. This greatly facilitates kinetic interpretations in terms of the integer-valued random processes that produce the fluctuations.},

Rearward nuclear movement was coupled with actin retrograde flow and was regulated by a pathway involving Cdc42, MRCK, myosin, and actin. Nuclear movement was unaffected by the inhibition of dynein, Par6, or PKCzeta, yet these components were essential for MTOC reorientation, as they maintained the MTOC at the cell centroid.

Changing the shape of the epithelial sheet altered the spatial pattern of EMT. Traction force microscopy and finite element modeling demonstrated that EMT-permissive regions experienced the highest mechanical stress. Myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF)-A was localized to the nuclei of cells located in high-stress regions, and inhibiting cytoskeletal tension or MRTF-A expression abrogated the spatial patterning of EMT.

The utility of these vectors following agroinfiltration into leaves has been demonstrated with four genes from Sonchus yellow net virus, a plant nucleorhabdovirus, and with a nucleolar marker protein. Of the three SYNV proteins tested, sc4 gave identical localization patterns at the cell wall and nucleus when fused to GFP or DsRed. However, some differences in expression patterns were observed depending on whether DsRed or GFP was the fusion partner. In this regard, the DsRed:P fusion showed a similar pattern of localization to GFP:P, but localized foci appeared in the nucleus and near the periphery of the nucleus. Nevertheless, the viral nucleocapsid protein, expressed as a GFP:N fusion, co-localized with DsRed:P in a subnuclear locale in agreement with our previous observations (Goodin et al., 2001). This locale appears to be distinct from the nucleolus as indicated by co-expression of the N protein, DsRed:P and a nucleolar marker AtFib1 fused to GFP. The SYNV M protein, which is believed to be particularly prone to oligomerization, was detectable only as a GFP fusion. Our results indicate that agroinfiltration with bacteria containing the pGD vectors is extremely useful for transient expression of several proteins in a high proportion of the cells of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The GFP and DsRed elements incorporated into the pGD system should greatly increase the ease of visualizing co-localization and interactions of proteins in a variety of experimental dicotyledonous hosts.},

Yet in finite asexual populations, purifying selection cannot completely prevent the accumulation of deleterious mutations due to Muller's ratchet: once lost by stochastic drift, the most-fit class of genotypes is lost forever. If deleterious mutations are weakly selected, Muller's ratchet can lead to a rapid degradation of population fitness. Evidently, the long-term stability of an asexual population requires an influx of beneficial mutations that continuously compensate for the accumulation of the weakly deleterious ones. Hence any stable evolutionary state of a population in a static environment must involve a dynamic mutation\textendash selection balance, where accumulation of deleterious mutations is on average offset by the influx of beneficial mutations. We argue that such a state can exist for any population size N and mutation rate U and calculate the fraction of beneficial mutations, {$\epsilon$}, that maintains the balanced state. We find that a surprisingly low {$\epsilon$} suffices to achieve stability, even in small populations in the face of high mutation rates and weak selection, maintaining a well-adapted population in spite of Muller's ratchet. This may explain the maintenance of mitochondria and other asexual genomes.},

Over the past several decades, many computational methods have been described for identifying, characterizing and searching with sequence motifs. Critical to nearly any motif-based sequence analysis pipeline is the ability to scan a sequence database for occurrences of a given motif described by a position-specific frequency matrix.Results: We describe Find Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO), a software tool for scanning DNA or protein sequences with motifs described as position-specific scoring matrices. The program computes a log-likelihood ratio score for each position in a given sequence database, uses established dynamic programming methods to convert this score to a P-value and then applies false discovery rate analysis to estimate a q-value for each position in the given sequence. FIMO provides output in a variety of formats, including HTML, XML and several Santa Cruz Genome Browser formats. The program is efficient, allowing for the scanning of DNA sequences at a rate of 3.5 Mb/s on a single CPU.Availability and Implementation: FIMO is part of the MEME Suite software toolkit.

  abstract = {Rapid cell type identification by new genomic single-cell analysis methods has not been met with efficient experimental access to these cell types. To facilitate access to specific neural populations in mouse cortex, we collected chromatin accessibility data from individual cells and identified enhancers specific for cell subclasses and types. When cloned into recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) and delivered to the brain, these enhancers drive transgene expression in specific cortical cell subclasses. We extensively characterized several enhancer AAVs to show that they label different projection neuron subclasses as well as a homologous neuron subclass in human cortical slices. We also show how coupling enhancer viruses expressing recombinases to a newly generated transgenic mouse, Ai213, enables strong labeling of three different neuronal classes/subclasses in the brain of a single transgenic animal. This approach combines unprecedented flexibility with specificity for investigation of cell types in the mouse brain and beyond.},

DNA methylation has numerous functions: it is implicated in the repression of transposons and genes, but is also associated with actively transcribed gene bodies and, in some cases, with gene activation per se. In recent years, sensitive technologies have been developed that allow the interrogation of DNA methylation patterns from a small number of cells. The use of these technologies has greatly improved our knowledge of DNA methylation dynamics and heterogeneity in embryos and in specific tissues. Combined with genetic analyses, it is increasingly apparent that regulation of DNA methylation erasure and (re-)establishment varies considerably between different developmental stages. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms and functions of DNA methylation and demethylation in both mice and humans at CpG-rich promoters, gene bodies and transposable elements. We highlight the dynamic erasure and re-establishment of DNA methylation in embryonic, germline and somatic cell development. Finally, we provide insights into DNA methylation gained from studying genetic diseases.},

Boundary elements such as Mcp, Fab-7, and Fab-8 and adjacent silencers flank the iab domains and restrict the activity of the iab enhancers. We have identified an insulator in the 755-bp Mcp fragment that is linked to the previously characterized Polycomb response element (PRE) and silences the adjacent genes. This insulator blocks the enhancers of the yellow and white genes and protects them from PRE-mediated repression. The interaction between the Mcp elements, each containing the insulator and PRE, allows the eye enhancer to activate the white promoter over the repressed yellow domain. The same level of white activation was observed when the Mcp element combined with the insulator alone was interposed between the eye enhancer and the promoter, suggesting that the insulator is responsible for the interaction between the Mcp elements.},

Little is known about the relationship between these elements' transcriptional activity and their mobility within the nucleus in living cells. Gu et al. developed a strategy to deliver multiple RNAs to guide inactive Cas9 to label these elements. Quantitative measurement of their movement during stem cell differentiation revealed that increased DNA loci mobility correlated with transcriptional activation. Science, this issue p. 1050 To achieve guide RNA (gRNA) multiplexing and an efficient delivery of tens of distinct gRNAs into single cells, we developed a molecular assembly strategy termed chimeric array of gRNA oligonucleotides (CARGO). We coupled CARGO with dCas9 (catalytically dead Cas9) imaging to quantitatively measure the movement of enhancers and promoters that undergo differentiation-associated activity changes in live embryonic stem cells. Whereas all examined functional elements exhibited subdiffusive behavior, their relative mobility increased concurrently with transcriptional activation. Furthermore, acute perturbation of RNA polymerase II activity can reverse these activity-linked increases in loci mobility. Through quantitative CARGO-dCas9 imaging, we provide direct measurements of cis-regulatory element dynamics in living cells and distinct cellular and activity states and uncover an intrinsic connection between cis-regulatory element mobility and transcription. Live-cell imaging of cis-regulatory DNA elements reveals an intrinsic connection between their transcriptional activity and nuclear mobility.

The function of the stable class of MTs is unknown and has been confounded by the apparent lack of organization of stable MTs within cells. Using an antibody against detyrosinated tubulin, a post-translationally modified form of tubulin that accumulates in stable MTs, we localized the stable MTs in mouse 3T3 cells induced to initiate directional migration by experimental wounding of confluent monolayers. Immediately after monolayer wounding, the distribution of stable MTs in cells at the wound edge resembled that in cells in the monolayer interior; most cells either contained randomly distributed stable MTs or lacked them entirely. However, by 20 min after wounding, cells at the wound margin began to generate an asymmetric MT array, with virtually all stable MTs oriented toward the cell edge in contact with the wound. Two hours after monolayer wounding, greater than or equal to 80\% of cells at the wound margin had generated this polarized array of stable MTs, and the array was maintained for at least 12 hr. MTs in the polarized array showed enhanced resistance to depolymerization by nocodazole, thus providing an independent test of their stability. Formation of the polar array of stable MTs appeared to precede onset of cell migration and closely paralleled reorientation of the MT-organizing center. These results show that cultured cells can remodel their MT array rapidly in response to an extracellular signal and suggest that selective stabilization of MTs is an early event in the generation of cellular asymmetry.},

The large subunit of Pol~II contains an intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain that is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases during the transition from initiation to elongation, thus influencing the interaction of the C-terminal domain with different components of the initiation or the RNA-splicing apparatus5,6. Recent observations suggest that this model provides only a partial picture of the effects of phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain7\textendash 12. Both the transcription-initiation machinery and the splicing machinery can form phase-separated condensates that contain large numbers of component molecules: hundreds of molecules of Pol~II and mediator are concentrated in condensates at super-enhancers7,8, and large numbers of splicing factors are concentrated in nuclear speckles, some of which occur at highly active transcription sites9\textendash 12. Here we investigate whether the phosphorylation of the Pol~II C-terminal domain regulates the incorporation of Pol II into phase-separated condensates that are associated with transcription initiation and splicing. We find that the hypophosphorylated C-terminal domain of Pol~II is incorporated into mediator condensates and that phosphorylation by regulatory cyclin-dependent kinases reduces this incorporation. We also find that the hyperphosphorylated C-terminal domain is preferentially incorporated into condensates that are formed by splicing factors. These results suggest that phosphorylation of the Pol~II C-terminal domain drives an exchange from condensates that are involved in transcription initiation to those that are involved in RNA processing, and implicates phosphorylation as a mechanism that regulates condensate preference.},

We describe here an approach to screening for agents with epithelial CSC-specific toxicity. We implemented this method in a chemical screen and discovered compounds showing selective toxicity for breast CSCs. One compound, salinomycin, reduces the proportion of CSCs by {$>$}100-fold relative to paclitaxel, a commonly used breast cancer chemotherapeutic drug. Treatment of mice with salinomycin inhibits mammary tumor growth in vivo and induces increased epithelial differentiation of tumor cells. In addition, global gene expression analyses show that salinomycin treatment results in the loss of expression of breast CSC genes previously identified by analyses of breast tissues isolated directly from patients. This study demonstrates the ability to identify agents with specific toxicity for epithelial CSCs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In migrating cells, the retrograde flow of filamentous actin (f-actin) from the leading edge toward the cell body is accompanied by the synchronous motion of microtubules (MTs, ), whose plus ends undergo net growth. Thus, MTs must depolymerize elsewhere in the cell to maintain polymer mass over time. The source and location of depolymerized MTs is unknown. Here, we test the hypothesis that MT polymer loss occurs in central cell regions and is induced by the convergence of actin retrograde and anterograde flow, which buckles and breaks associated MTs and promotes minus-end depolymerization. RESULTS: We characterized the effects of calyculin A and ML-7 on the movement of f-actin and MTs by multi-spectral fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM). Our studies show that these drugs affect the rate of f-actin and MT convergence and MT buckling in a central cell region we call the "convergence zone." Increases in f-actin convergence are associated with faster MT turnover and an increase in both MT breakage and minus-end depolymerization, but they have no effect on MT plus end dynamic instability. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that f-actin movement into the convergence zone plays a major role in spatially modulating MT turnover during cell migration by regulating MT breakage, and thus minus-end dynamics, in central cell regions.},

MALAT1, also known as nuclear-enriched transcript 2 (NEAT2), was discovered as a prognostic marker for lung cancer metastasis but also has been linked to several other human tumor entities. Recent work established a critical regulatory function of this lncRNA in lung cancer metastasis and cell migration. Moreover, MALAT1 is an interesting target for antimetastatic therapy in non-small cell lung carcinoma. Two alternative modes of action have been proposed for MALAT1: regulation of gene expression or alternative splicing. Although the exact mechanism of action in different physiological and pathological conditions still needs to be elucidated, MALAT1 acts as a regulator of gene expression. Although MALAT1 is highly evolutionary conserved in mammals and plays an important role in cancer and metastasis, MALAT1 is not essential for development in a knockout mouse model under normal physiological conditions. Hence, one central question for the future is finding the right stressor and the pathological or environmental condition which requires MALAT1 expression in vivo and entailing its strong evolutionary conservation. Here, we summarize the current knowledge about this important lncRNA. We introduce its discovery, biogenesis, and regulation and describe its known functions, mechanisms of action, and interaction partners.},

  abstract = {The bithorax complex specifies the identity of parasegments 5-14 of Drosophila. Although nine parasegment-specific functions, abx/bx, bxd/pbx and iab-2 to iab-8,9 have been identified, the whole bithorax complex appears to encode only three classes of proteins, Ubx, abd-A and Abd-B. Many observations suggest that the parasegment-specific functions act as positive cis-regulatory elements of Ubx, abd-A and Abd-B. We report the molecular genetics of a new gain-of-function mutation, Fab-7, which transforms parasegment 11 into parasegment 12. Induction of Abd-B mutations in cis (one of which removes the Abd-B homeobox) causes reversion of the dominant phenotype, demonstrating that Fab-7 misregulates Abd-B. A 4 kb deletion, 30 kb downstream from the Abd-B transcription unit, is solely responsible for the Fab-7 phenotype. We consider that the parasegment-specific functions lie in DNA domains that are sequentially and independently 'opened' along the chromosome. Once a domain is opened, the cis-regulatory sequences within it can carry out their function. We propose that the Fab-7 deletion removes a boundary separating the iab-6 and iab-7 cis-regulatory regions (the functions specific for parasegments 11 and 12) allowing the open configuration of iab-6 to invade iab-7 in parasegment 11. This is strongly supported by our finding that Fab-7 can be caused to revert by lesions not only in iab-7 but also in iab-6.},

Here, we use a super-resolution microscopy approach, Optical Reconstruction of Chromatin Architecture (ORCA) 5 to measure the effects of removal of CTCF or cohesin on genome folding across genomic scales. In untreated embryonic stem cells, we observe intricate, frequently stacked loops of chromatin which are largely dissolved upon cohesin removal. The loops compact chromatin at the {$<$} 3 Mb scale, increasing proximity between sequences not only within but also between TADs. We find multi-way contacts among loop anchors, preferentially at TAD borders, and these hubs largely dissolve upon CTCF degradation. CTCF-hubs bridge intervening TAD boundaries while keeping border distal regions from neighboring TADs apart outside the hub. Cohesin dependent loops at the {$<$} 3 Mb scale impede mixing at larger chromosomal scales through steric effects of loop stacking, dramatically reducing genomic cross-talk. Disruption of this ordered chromosomal structure led to increased cell-cell variability in gene expression, exceeding changes to average expression. Together our data revise the TAD-centric understanding of CTCF and cohesin, and provide a multi-scale, structural picture of how they organize the genome on the single-cell level through distinct contributions to loop stacking.},

Genetic analysis indicates that removal of the Fab-7 element results in the fusion of the iab-6 (PS11) and iab-7 (PS12) cis-regulatory domains into a single regulatory domain that inappropriately regulates Abdominal-B in PS11. This has led to the hypothesis that Fab-7 is a chromatin domain boundary that normally functions to ensure the autonomous activity of the iab-6 and iab-7 cis-regulatory domains. We use several different enhancer blocking assays to demonstrate that Fab-7 has the insulating properties expected of a domain boundary. We define a minimal fragment of Fab-7 sufficient for enhancer blocking, and demonstrate that it is completely distinct from an adjacent Polycomb-dependent silencer. We compare Fab-7 to the su(Hw) insulator element, and show that Fab-7 enhancer blocking activity is intermediate between that of five and twelve reiterated binding sites for the Su(Hw) protein. These results support the model that Fab-7 functions as a domain boundary within the context of the bithorax complex, making Fab-7 one of the first boundary elements that is known to have an essential function in vivo.},

  abstract = {The first expression and distribution of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was studied among a distinct population of early neurons in embryonic zebrafish by using histochemical and retrograde labeling techniques. AChE first appeared in the nervous system in the primary motoneurons of the rostral spinal cord when the embryo had nine somites, approximately 14 hours postfertilization. Subsequent expression of AChE activity in the spinal cord proceeded in a rostral-to-caudal sequence. Cranial neurons expressed AChE activity shortly after it appeared in the rostral spinal cord. Several hours later, near the end of the first day, primary neurons in the hindbrain and spinal cord all contained AChE, including sensory neurons, reticulospinal interneurons, and primary motoneurons. AChE activity was also detected in the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Presumptive cranial ganglia transiently expressed AChE activity between 14 and 24 hours of development. These results, combined with previous observations that examined the time of origin and axogenesis of primary neurons, suggest that primary neurons in the embryonic zebrafish contain AChE before they sprout axons. The primary neurons appear to follow a common sequence of development consisting of a withdrawal from the cell division cycle, the expression of AChE, and axogenesis. Although this sequence is followed by all primary neurons, lack of a rostral-to-caudal sequence in the time of birth and variability in the time of axon outgrowth demonstrate that the relative timing of these three events is not rigidly programmed in individual neurons. Moreover, the very early expression of AChE in such diverse cell types suggests that it may have a developmental role in addition to its function in transmitter metabolism.},

Reports of SALL4 serological levels linked to HCC patients are meager and unclear in the prognosis of this malignancy. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry and optical microscopy protocols were used to examine the presence of SALL4 in liver tissues from the following patients: 38 HCC, 11 chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV), 13 liver cirrhosis, and 12 healthy controls. Additionally, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the SALL4 levels in serum samples isolated from patients as follows: 127 with HCC, 27 with HBV, 24 with liver cirrhosis, and 23 normal controls. RESULTS: Analysis of liver tissues sections from HCC patients (18 out 38; 47.4\%) showed positive staining for SALL4 and its expression did no correlate with any of the clinicopathologic characteristics. HCC patients displayed higher levels (50.4\%) of SALL4 protein in serum, compared with the three control groups. Moreover, SALL4 concentration reached the maximum level after one week after treatment and dropped quickly after one month. These HCC patients showing high SALL4 serum levels had poor prognosis, evidenced by both tumor recurrence and overall survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: High SALL4 serum levels are a novel biomarker in the prognosis of HCC patients.},

How mammalian DNA-binding proteins overcome this challenge to efficiently locate their target sites is not known. Here, through live-cell single-molecule tracking, we show that CCCTC-binding factor, CTCF, is repeatedly trapped in small zones that likely correspond to CTCF clusters, in a manner that is largely dependent on an internal RNA-binding region (RBRi). We develop a new theoretical model called anisotropic diffusion through transient trapping in zones to explain CTCF dynamics. Functionally, transient RBRi-mediated trapping increases the efficiency of CTCF target search by \textasciitilde 2.5-fold. Overall, our results suggest a `guided' mechanism where CTCF clusters concentrate diffusing CTCF proteins near cognate binding sites, thus increasing the local ON-rate. We suggest that local guiding may allow DNA-binding proteins to more efficiently locate their target sites.},

However, accurately inferring information from SPT studies is challenging due to biases in both data analysis and experimental design. To address analysis bias, we introduce `Spot-On', an intuitive web-interface. Spot-On implements a kinetic modeling framework that accounts for known biases, including molecules moving out-of-focus, and robustly infers diffusion constants and subpopulations from pooled single-molecule trajectories. To minimize inherent experimental biases, we implement and validate stroboscopic photo-activation SPT (spaSPT), which minimizes motion-blur bias and tracking errors. We validate Spot-On using experimentally realistic simulations and show that Spot-On outperforms other methods. We then apply Spot-On to spaSPT data from live mammalian cells spanning a wide range of nuclear dynamics and demonstrate that Spot-On consistently and robustly infers subpopulation fractions and diffusion constants.},

  abstract = {Mammalian genomes are folded into topologically associating domains (TADs), consisting of chromatin loops anchored by CTCF and cohesin. Some loops are cell-type specific. Here we asked whether CTCF loops are established by a universal or locus-specific mechanism. Investigating the molecular determinants of CTCF clustering, we found that CTCF self-association in~vitro is RNase sensitive and that an internal RNA-binding region (RBRi) mediates CTCF clustering and RNA interaction in~vivo. Strikingly, deleting the RBRi impairs about half of all chromatin loops in mESCs and causes deregulation of gene expression. Disrupted loop formation correlates with diminished clustering and chromatin binding of RBRi mutant CTCF, which in turn results in a failure to halt cohesin-mediated extrusion. Thus, CTCF loops fall into at least two classes: RBRi-independent and RBRi-dependent loops. We speculate that evidence for RBRi-dependent loops may provide a molecular mechanism for establishing cell-specific CTCF loops, potentially regulated by RNA(s) or other RBRi-interacting partners.},

Prior work suggests that signal-specific gene expression changes are partly achieved because different gene promoters exhibit distinct induction dynamics in response to the same TF input signal. Here, using high-throughput quantitative single-cell measurements and a novel statistical method, we systematically analyzed transcriptional responses to a large number of dynamic TF inputs. In particular, we quantified the scaling behavior among different transcriptional features extracted from the measured trajectories such as the gene activation delay or duration of promoter activity. Surprisingly, we found that even the same gene promoter can exhibit qualitatively distinct induction and scaling behaviors when exposed to different dynamic TF contexts. While it was previously known that promoters fall into distinct classes, here we show that the same promoter can switch between different classes depending on context. Thus, promoters can adopt context-dependent ?manifestations?. Our analysis suggests that the full complexity of signal processing by genetic circuits may be significantly underestimated when studied in only specific contexts.},

We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of 211,000 human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with panels extending to 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. Multimodal analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states, allowing us to identify and validate previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyze single-cell multimodal datasets and to look beyond the transcriptome toward a unified and multimodal definition of cellular identity.},

This event is dependent upon an imprinted-control region two kilobases upstream of H19 (refs 1, 2). On the paternal chromosome this element is methylated and required for the silencing of H19 (refs 2,3,4). On the maternal chromosome the region is unmethylated and required for silencing of the Igf2 gene 90 kilobases upstream2. We have proposed that the unmethylated imprinted-control region acts as a chromatin boundary that blocks the interaction of Igf2 with enhancers that lie 3{${'}$} of H19 (refs 5, 6). This enhancer-blocking activity would then be lost when the region was methylated, thereby allowing expression of Igf2 paternally. Here we show, using transgenic mice and tissue culture, that the unmethylated imprinted-control regions from mouse and human H19 exhibit enhancer-blocking activity. Furthermore, we show that CTCF, a zinc finger protein implicated in vertebrate boundary function7, binds to several sites in the unmethylated imprinted-control region that are essential for enhancer blocking. Consistent with our model, CTCF binding is abolished by DNA methylation. This is the first example, to our knowledge, of a regulated chromatin boundary in vertebrates.},

The relationship between gene expression and the spatial organisation of chromatin is highly complex, interdependent and not completely understood. The development of experimental techniques to interrogate both the higher-order structure of chromatin and the interactions between regulatory elements has recently lead to important insights on how gene expression is controlled. The ability to gain these and future insights is critically dependent on computational tools for the analysis and visualisation of data produced by these techniques. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We have developed GenomicInteractions, a freely available R/Bioconductor package designed for processing, analysis and visualisation of data generated from various types of chromosome conformation capture experiments. The package allows the easy annotation and summarisation of large genome-wide datasets at both the level of individual interactions and sets of genomic features, and provides several different methods for interrogating and visualising this type of data. We demonstrate this package's utility by showing example analyses performed on interaction datasets generated using Hi-C and ChIA-PET.},

  abstract = {This chapter describes the use of glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene fusion proteins as a method for inducible, high-level protein expression and purification from bacterial cell lysates. The protein is expressed in a pGEX vector, with the GST moiety located at the N terminus followed by the target protein. The use of GST as a fusion tag is desirable because it can act as a chaperone to facilitate protein folding, and frequently the fusion protein can be expressed as a soluble protein rather than in inclusion bodies. Additionally, the GST fusion protein can be affinity purified facilely without denaturation or use of mild detergents. The fusion protein is captured by immobilized glutathione and impurities are washed away. The fusion protein then is eluted under mild, non-denaturing conditions using reduced glutathione. If desired, the removal of the GST affinity tag is accomplished by using a site-specific protease recognition sequence located between the GST moiety and the target protein. Purified proteins have been used successfully in immunological studies, structure determinations, vaccine production, protein\textendash protein, and protein\textendash DNA interaction studies and other biochemical analyses.},

Myogenin-mutant mice differ from mice carrying mutations in genes for the related myogenic factors Myf5 and MyoD, which have no muscle defects. Myogenin is therefore essential for the development of functional skeletal muscle.},

  abstract = {Many large-scale, high-throughput experiments use DNA barcodes, short DNA sequences prepended to DNA libraries, for identification of individuals in pooled biomolecule populations. However, DNA synthesis and sequencing errors confound the correct interpretation of observed barcodes and can lead to significant data loss or spurious results. Widely used error-correcting codes borrowed from computer science (e.g., Hamming, Levenshtein codes) do not properly account for insertions and deletions (indels) in DNA barcodes, even though deletions are the most common type of synthesis error. Here, we present and experimentally validate filled/truncated right end edit (FREE) barcodes, which correct substitution, insertion, and deletion errors, even when these errors alter the barcode length. FREE barcodes are designed with experimental considerations in mind, including balanced guanine-cytosine (GC) content, minimal homopolymer runs, and reduced internal hairpin propensity. We generate and include lists of barcodes with different lengths and error correction levels that may be useful in diverse high-throughput applications, including {$>$}106 single-error\textendash correcting 16-mers that strike a balance between decoding accuracy, barcode length, and library size. Moreover, concatenating two or more FREE codes into a single barcode increases the available barcode space combinatorially, generating lists with {$>$}1015 error-correcting barcodes. The included software for creating barcode libraries and decoding sequenced barcodes is efficient and designed to be user-friendly for the general biology community.},

Such factors are able to prime enhancers in a cell type-specific manner by binding to closely spaced recognition motifs.Signal-dependent transcription factors, such as nuclear receptors and nuclear factor-{$\kappa$}B (NF-{$\kappa$}B), primarily bind to regions of the genome that are primed in a cell type-specific manner by lineage-determining transcription factors. This enables such broadly expressed, signal-dependent transcription factors to regulate gene expression in a cell type-specific manner.A proportion of the genome contains a very high density of marks of active enhancers. Such enhancer-rich genomic regions, which are called super-enhancers, are different in each cell type and regulate genes required for establishing cell identity and function.An understanding of the mechanisms underlying the cell type-specific selection and function of enhancers will improve our understanding of the effects of natural genetic variation on complex phenotypes and diseases.},

It is a versatile technique that can be used for transient expression studies as well as for creating stable transformants. The HeliosTM gene gun uses DNA-coated gold particles that are precipitated on the inner wall of a plastic tube and accelerated by pressurized helium. It differs from previous particle bombardment methods since it operates in ambient pressure and can be used. e.g. in the field. The aim of this study was to optimize parameters for transient expression of gene constructs into arabidopsis, tobacco and birch with the HeliosTM Gene Gun. In order to investigate transient gene delivery, we used constructs containing the constitutively active promoter of the CaMV 35S transcript fused with reporter genes encoding luciferase (LUC) and {$\beta$}-glucuronidase (GUS). Optimization was performed in a step-by-step manner. We found that the most critical parameters were helium pressure, the optimum of which varied between plant species, and the amount of gold. Gold particles with a diameter of 0.6 {$\mu$}m were best for all plant species studied. The optimization procedure helped to increase the expression levels five- to ten-fold.},

Seemingly incongruent with the tight regulation of transcription, many biochemical and biophysical studies suggest that activators use nonspecific hydrophobic and/or electrostatic interactions to bind to coactivators, with few if any specific contacts. Here a mechanistic dissection of a set of representative dynamic activator\textbullet coactivator complexes, comprised of the ETV/PEA3 family of activators and the coactivator Med25, reveals a different molecular recognition model. The data demonstrate that small sequence variations within an activator family significantly redistribute the conformational ensemble of the complex while not affecting overall affinity, and distal residues within the activator\textemdash not often considered as contributing to binding\textemdash play a key role in mediating conformational redistribution. The ETV/PEA3\textbullet Med25 ensembles are directed by specific contacts between the disordered activator and the Med25 interface, which is facilitated by structural shifts of the coactivator binding surface. Taken together, these data highlight the critical role coactivator plasticity plays in recognition of disordered activators and indicate that molecular recognition models of disordered proteins must consider the ability of the binding partners to mediate specificity.},

Euchromatin, which is permissive for transcription, is spatially organized into transcriptionally inactive domains interspersed with pockets of transcriptional activity. While transcription and RNA have been implicated in euchromatin organization, it remains unclear how their interplay forms and maintains transcription pockets. Here we combine theory and experiment to analyze the dynamics of euchromatin organization as pluripotent zebrafish cells exit mitosis and begin transcription. We show that accumulation of RNA induces formation of transcription pockets which displace transcriptionally inactive chromatin. We propose that the accumulating RNA recruits RNA-binding proteins that together tend to separate from transcriptionally inactive euchromatin. Full phase separation is prevented because RNA remains tethered to transcribed euchromatin through RNA polymerases. Instead, smaller scale microphases emerge that do not grow further and form the typical pattern of euchromatin organization.},

Here we show that a mutation in the zebrafish myod gene delays and reduces early somitic and pectoral fin myogenesis, reduces miR-206 expression, and leads to a persistent reduction in somite size until at least the independent feeding stage. A mutation in myog, encoding a second MRF, has little obvious phenotype at early stages, but exacerbates the loss of somitic muscle caused by lack of Myod. Mutation of both myod and myf5 ablates all skeletal muscle. Haploinsufficiency of myod leads to reduced embryonic somite muscle bulk. Lack of Myod causes a severe reduction in cranial musculature, ablating most muscles including the protractor pectoralis, a putative cucullaris homologue. This phenotype is accompanied by a severe dysmorphology of the cartilaginous skeleton and failure of maturation of several cranial bones, including the opercle. As myod expression is restricted to myogenic cells, the data show that myogenesis is essential for proper skeletogenesis in the head.},

  abstract = {Paraspeckles are subnuclear structures formed around nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1)/MEN{$\epsilon$}/{$\beta$} long noncoding RNA (lncRNA). Here we show that paraspeckles become dramatically enlarged after proteasome inhibition. This enlargement is mainly caused by NEAT1 transcriptional up-regulation rather than accumulation of undegraded paraspeckle proteins. Of interest, however, using immuno-electron microscopy, we find that key paraspeckle proteins become effectively depleted from the nucleoplasm by 50\% when paraspeckle assembly is enhanced, suggesting a sequestration mechanism. We also perform microarrays from NEAT1-knockdown cells and find that NEAT1 represses transcription of several genes, including the RNA-specific adenosine deaminase B2 (ADARB2) gene. In contrast, the NEAT1-binding paraspeckle protein splicing factor proline/glutamine-rich (SFPQ) is required for ADARB2 transcription. This leads us to hypothesize that ADARB2 expression is controlled by NEAT1-dependent sequestration of SFPQ. Accordingly, we find that ADARB2 expression is strongly reduced upon enhanced SFPQ sequestration by proteasome inhibition, with concomitant reduction in SFPQ binding to the ADARB2 promoter. Finally, NEAT1(-/-) fibroblasts are more sensitive to proteasome inhibition, which triggers cell death, suggesting that paraspeckles/NEAT1 attenuates the cell death pathway. These data further confirm that paraspeckles are stress-responsive nuclear bodies and provide a model in which induced NEAT1 controls target gene transcription by protein sequestration into paraspeckles.},

  abstract = {Most common diseases are complex genetic traits, with multiple genetic and environmental components contributing to susceptibility. It has been proposed that common genetic variants, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), influence susceptibility to common disease. This proposal has begun to be tested in numerous studies of association between genetic variation at these common DNA polymorphisms and variation in disease susceptibility. We have performed an extensive review of such association studies. We find that over 600 positive associations between common gene variants and disease have been reported; these associations, if correct, would have tremendous importance for the prevention, prediction, and treatment of most common diseases. However, most reported associations are not robust: of the 166 putative associations which have been studied three or more times, only 6 have been consistently replicated. Interestingly, of the remaining 160 associations, well over half were observed again one or more times. We discuss the possible reasons for this irreproducibility and suggest guidelines for performing and interpreting genetic association studies. In particular, we emphasize the need for caution in drawing conclusions from a single report of an association between a genetic variant and disease susceptibility.},

Here we demonstrate critical and distinct roles for Sall4 in development of embryonic germ cells and differentiation of postnatal spermatogonial progenitor cells (SPCs). In differentiating SPCs, Sall4 levels transiently increase and Sall4 physically interacts with Plzf, a transcription factor exclusively required for adult stem cell maintenance. Mechanistically, Sall4 sequesters Plzf to noncognate chromatin domains to induce expression of Kit, a target of Plzf-mediated repression required for differentiation. Plzf in turn antagonizes Sall4 function by displacing Sall4 from cognate chromatin to induce Sall1 expression. Taken together, these data suggest that transcription factors required for embryonic tissue development postnatally take on distinct roles through interaction with opposing factors, which hence define properties of the adult stem cell compartment.},

  abstract = {Individual cells from isogenic populations often display large cell-to-cell differences in gene expression. This ``noise'' in expression derives from several sources, including the genomic and cellular environment in which a gene resides. Large-scale maps of genomic environments have revealed the effects of epigenetic modifications and transcription factor occupancy on mean expression levels, but leveraging such maps to explain expression noise will require new methods to assay how expression noise changes at locations across the genome. To address this gap, we present Single-cell Analysis of Reporter Gene Expression Noise and Transcriptome (SARGENT), a method that simultaneously measures the noisiness of reporter genes integrated throughout the genome and the global mRNA profiles of individual reporter-gene-containing cells. Using SARGENT, we performed the first comprehensive genome-wide survey of how genomic locations impact gene expression noise. We found that the mean and noise of expression correlate with different histone modifications. We quantified the intrinsic and extrinsic components of reporter gene noise and, using the associated mRNA profiles, assigned the extrinsic component to differences between the CD24+ ``stem-like'' sub-state and the more ``differentiated'' sub-state. SARGENT also reveals the effects of transgene integrations on endogenous gene expression, which will help guide the search for ``safe-harbor'' loci. Taken together, we show that SARGENT is a powerful tool to measure both the mean and noise of gene expression at locations across the genome, and that the data generated by SARGENT reveals important insights into the regulation of gene expression noise genome-wide.},

However, examples of core promoter specificity have led to an alternate hypothesis in which specificity is achieved by core promoters with different sequence motifs that respond differently to genomic environments containing different enhancers and chromatin landscapes. To distinguish between these models, we measured the activities of hundreds of diverse core promoters in four different genomic locations and, in a complementary experiment, six different core promoters at thousands of locations across the genome. Although genomic locations had large effects on expression, the intrinsic activities of different classes of promoters were preserved across genomic locations, suggesting that core promoters are modular regulatory elements whose activities are independently scaled up or down by different genomic locations. This scaling of promoter activities is nonlinear and depends on the genomic location and the strength of the core promoter.

  abstract = {Insulators are cis-regulatory sequences (CRSs) that can block enhancers from activating target promoters or act as barriers to block the spread of heterochromatin. Their name derives from their ability to 'insulate' transgenes from genomic position effects, an important function in gene therapy and biotechnology applications that require high levels of sustained transgene expression. In theory, flanking transgenes with insulators protects them from position effects, but in practice, efforts to insulate transgenes meet with mixed success because the contextual requirements for insulator function in the genome are not well understood. A key question is whether insulators are modular elements that can function anywhere in the genome or whether they are adapted to function only in certain genomic locations. To distinguish between these two possibilities we developed MPIRE (Massively Parallel Integrated Regulatory Elements) and used it to measure the effects of three insulators (A2, cHS4, ALOXE3) and their mutants at thousands of locations across the genome. Our results show that each insulator functions in only a small number of genomic locations, and that insulator function depends on the sequence motifs that comprise each insulator. All three insulators can block enhancers in the genome, but specificity arises because each insulator blocks enhancers that are bound by different sets of transcription factors. All three insulators can block enhancers in the genome, but only ALOXE3 can act as a heterochromatin barrier. We conclude that insulator function is highly context dependent and that MPIRE is a robust and systematic method for revealing the context dependencies of insulators and other cis-regulatory elements across the genome.},

A variant of the neurotropic vector adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 9, called AAV-PHP.B, was shown to very efficiently deliver transgenes across the BBB in C57BL/6J mice. Based on our recent observation that this phenotype is mouse strain dependent, we used whole-exome sequencing-based genetics to map this phenotype to a specific haplotype of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus A (Ly6a) (stem cell antigen-1 [Sca-1]), which encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein whose function had been thought to be limited to the biology of hematopoiesis. Additional biochemical and genetic studies definitively linked high BBB transport to the binding of AAV-PHP.B with LY6A (SCA-1). These studies identify, for the first time, a ligand for this GPI-anchored protein and suggest a role for it in BBB transport that could be hijacked by viruses in natural infections or by gene therapy vectors to treat neurological diseases.},

  abstract = {Gene expression depends on the frequency of transcription events (burst frequency) and on the number of mRNA molecules made per event (burst size). Both processes are encoded in promoter sequence, yet their dependence on mutations is poorly understood. Theory suggests that burst size and frequency can be distinguished by monitoring the stochastic variation (noise) in gene expression: Increasing burst size will increase mean expression without changing noise, while increasing burst frequency will increase mean expression and decrease noise. To reveal principles by which promoter sequence regulates burst size and frequency, we randomly mutated 22 yeast promoters chosen to span a range of expression and noise levels, generating libraries of hundreds of sequence variants. In each library, mean expression (m) and noise (coefficient of variation, {$\eta$}) varied together, defining a scaling curve: {$\eta$}2 = b/m + {$\eta$}ext2. This relation is expected if sequence mutations modulate burst frequency primarily. The estimated burst size (b) differed between promoters, being higher in promoter containing a TATA box and lacking a nucleosome-free region. The rare variants that significantly decreased b were explained by mutations in TATA, or by an insertion of an out-of-frame translation start site. The decrease in burst size due to mutations in TATA was promoter-dependent, but independent of other mutations. These TATA box mutations also modulated the responsiveness of gene expression to changing conditions. Our results suggest that burst size is a promoter-specific property that is relatively robust to sequence mutations but is strongly dependent on the interaction between the TATA box and promoter nucleosomes.},

This last function has been the subject of intense research ever since the discovery of cohesin's role in the long-range regulation of the cut gene in Drosophila. Subsequent research showed that the expression of some genes is exquisitely sensitive to cohesin depletion, while others remain relatively unperturbed. Sensitivity to cohesin depletion is also remarkably cell type- and/or condition-specific. The relatively recent discovery that cohesin is integral to forming chromatin loops via loop extrusion should explain much of cohesin's gene regulatory properties, but surprisingly, loop extrusion has failed to identify a `one size fits all' mechanism for how cohesin controls gene expression. This review will illustrate how early examples of cohesin-dependent gene expression integrate with later work on cohesin's role in genome organization to explain mechanisms by which cohesin regulates gene expression.},

  abstract = {Paclitaxel, an antitumor drug that is demonstrating encouraging activity in human malignancies, is likely to play a major role in cancer chemotherapy. Paclitaxel has an unusual chemical structure--it is a complex diterpene having a taxane ring with a four-membered oxetane ring and an ester side chain at position C-13--and a unique mechanism of action. In vitro, paclitaxel enhances the polymerization of tubulin to stable microtubules and also interacts directly with microtubules, stabilizing them against depolymerization by cold and calcium, which readily depolymerize normal microtubules. The fact that the drug has a specific binding site on the microtubule polymer makes it unique among chemotherapeutic agents, and the ability of paclitaxel to polymerize tubulin in the absence of cofactors like guanosine triphosphate and microtubule-associated proteins is unusual. When paclitaxel and microtubule protein are irradiated with ultraviolet light, the drug preferentially binds covalently to the beta-subunit of tubulin. Paclitaxel binds to cells in a specific and saturable manner with a single set of high-affinity binding sites. The microtubule cytoskeleton is reorganized in the presence of paclitaxel and extensive parallel arrays or stable bundles of microtubules are formed in cells growing in tissue culture. Paclitaxel blocks cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and such cells are unable to form a normal mitotic apparatus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Here we find that physical domains in Drosophila chromosomes are demarcated at regions of active transcription and high gene density that are enriched for transcription factors and specific combinations of insulator proteins. Physical domains contain different types of chromatin defined by the presence of specific proteins and epigenetic marks, with active chromatin preferentially located at the borders and silenced chromatin in the interior. Domain boundaries participate in long-range interactions that may contribute to the clustering of regions of active or silenced chromatin in the nucleus. Analysis of transgenes suggests that chromatin is more accessible and permissive to transcription at the borders than inside domains, independent of the presence of active or silencing histone modifications. These results suggest that the higher-order physical organization of chromatin may impose an additional level of regulation over classical epigenetic marks.},

An extra copy of HS5 placed between the {$\beta$}-globin locus control region (LCR) and downstream genes on a transgene fulfills the classic predictions for an enhancer-blocker. Ectopic HS5 does not perturb the LCR but blocks gene activation by interfering with RNA pol II, activator and coactivator recruitment, and epigenetic modification at the downstream {$\beta$}-globin gene. Underlying these effects, ectopic HS5 disrupts chromatin loop formation between {$\beta$}-globin and the LCR, and instead forms a new loop with endogenous HS5 that topologically isolates the LCR. Both enhancer-blocking and insulator-loop formation depend on an intact CTCF site in ectopic HS5 and are sensitive to knock-down of the CTCF protein by siRNA. Thus, intrinsic looping activity of CTCF sites can nullify LCR function.},

Transgenesis includes the addition of foreign genetic information to animals and specific inhibition of endogenous gene expression. Recently, animal models provided novel insight and significantly improved our understanding of the initiation and perpetuation of human diseases. Moreover, they are an invaluable tool for target discovery, validation, and production of therapeutic proteins. However, despite the generation of several transgenic and knockout models, obtaining relevant models still faces several theoretical and technical challenges. Indeed, genes of interest are not always available and gene addition or inactivation sometimes does not allow clear conclusions because of the intrinsic complexity of living organisms or the redundancy of some metabolic pathways. In addition to homologous recombination, endogenous gene expression can be specifically inhibited using several mechanisms such as RNA interference. Here, some animal models are described to illustrate their importance in biomedical research. Moreover, guidelines for generation of these animals are presented.},

Focusing on the highly heterogeneous mammalian cerebral cortex, we apply PESCA to find enhancers and generate viral reagents capable of accessing and manipulating a subset of somatostatin-expressing cortical interneurons with high specificity.

We find that insulation potency depends on the number of CTCF-binding sites in tandem. Furthermore, CTCF-mediated insulation is dependent on upstream flanking sequences at its binding sites. CTCF-binding sites at topologically associating domain boundaries are more likely to function as insulators than those outside topologically associating domain boundaries, independently of binding strength. We demonstrate that insulators form local chromatin domain boundaries and weaken enhancer\textendash promoter contacts.

Different degrees of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) have been found to occur in carcinomas from breast, colon and ovarian carcinoma (OC), among others. Numerous studies have focused on bona fide epithelial and mesenchymal states but rarely on intermediate states. In this study, we describe a model system for appraising the spectrum of EMT using 43 well-characterised OC cell lines. Phenotypic EMT characterisation reveals four subgroups: Epithelial, Intermediate E, Intermediate M and Mesenchymal, which represent different epithelial-mesenchymal compositions along the EMT spectrum. In cell-based EMT-related functional studies, OC cells harbouring an Intermediate M phenotype are characterised by high N-cadherin and ZEB1 expression and low E-cadherin and ERBB3/HER3 expression and are more anoikis-resistant and spheroidogenic. A specific Src-kinase inhibitor, Saracatinib (AZD0530), restores E-cadherin expression in Intermediate M cells in in vitro and in vivo models and abrogates spheroidogenesis. We show how a 33-gene EMT Signature can sub-classify an OC cohort into four EMT States correlating with progression-free survival (PFS). We conclude that the characterisation of intermediate EMT states provides a new approach to better define EMT. The concept of the EMT Spectrum allows the utilisation of EMT genes as predictive markers and the design and application of therapeutic targets for reversing EMT in a selective subgroup of patients.},

Using \emph{Drosophila} embryos undergoing the first wave of genome activation, we detected discrete ``speckles'' of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), and showed that they overlap with transcribing loci. We characterized the spatial distribution of Pol II speckles and quantified how this distribution changes in the absence of the primary driver of \emph{Drosophila} genome activation, the pioneer factor Zelda. Although the number and size of Pol II speckles were reduced, indicating that Zelda promotes Pol II speckle formation, we observed a uniform distribution of distances between active genes in the nuclei of both wildtype and \emph{zelda} mutant embryos. This suggests that the topologically associated domains identified by Hi-C studies do little to spatially constrain groups of transcribed genes at this time. We provide evidence that linear genomic distance between transcribed genes is the primary determinant of measured physical distance between the active loci. Furthermore, we show active genes can have distinct Pol II pools even if the active loci are in close proximity. In contrast to the emerging model whereby active genes are clustered to facilitate co-regulation and sharing of transcriptional resources, our data support an ``individualist'' model of gene control at early genome activation in \emph{Drosophila}. This model is in contrast to a ``collectivist'' model where active genes are spatially clustered and share transcriptional resources, motivating rigorous tests of both models in other experimental systems.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Enhancers contain transcription-factor-binding sites (which are typically around 7\textendash 22~bp), and physical contact between the promoters and enhancers is thought to be required to modulate gene expression. Although chromatin architecture has been mapped extensively at resolutions of 1~kilobase and above; it has not been possible to define physical contacts at the scale of the proteins that determine gene expression. Here we define these interactions in detail using a chromosome conformation capture method (Micro-Capture-C) that enables the physical contacts between different classes of regulatory elements to be determined at base-pair resolution. We find that highly punctate contacts occur between enhancers, promoters and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites and we show that transcription factors have an important role in the maintenance of the contacts between enhancers and promoters. Our data show that interactions between CTCF sites are increased when active promoters and enhancers are located within the intervening chromatin. This supports a model in which chromatin loop extrusion1 is dependent on cohesin loading at active promoters and enhancers, which explains the formation of tissue-specific chromatin domains without changes in CTCF binding.},

  abstract = {The poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been associated with recurrence and metastasis. Recently, we established a pair of HCC cell lines from a primary (H2-P) and its matched metastatic (H2-M) HCC tumors. A high density of cDNA microarray with 9184 human cDNA was used to identify the differentially expressed genes between H2-P and H2-M. Comparing with H2-P, eight upregulated and six downregulated genes were detected in H2-M. One interesting finding is the overexpression of Vimentin (VIM), a well-defined intermediate filament, which has been linked to a more aggressive status in various tumors. The correlation of overexpression of VIM and HCC metastasis was studied by immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray with 200 primary HCCs and 60 pairs of primary and matched metastatic HCC samples. Tissue microarray demonstrated that the overexpression of VIM was significantly associated with HCC metastasis (P{$<$}0.01). This finding strongly suggests that the overexpression of VIM may play an important role in the metastasis of HCC.},

The histone lysine demethylase, LSD1, is required for these ligand-induced interactive loci to associate with distinct interchromatin granules, long thought to serve as "storage" sites for the splicing machinery, some critical transcription elongation factors, and various chromatin remodeling complexes. We demonstrate that this 2-step nuclear rearrangement is essential for achieving enhanced, coordinated transcription of nuclear receptor target genes.},

Here we show that CLIP (cytoplasmic linker protein)-associated protein (CLASP), originally identified as a MT plus end-binding protein, displays both plus end-binding and lattice-binding activities in nerve growth cones, and reveal that the two MT-binding activities regulate axon growth in an opposing manner: The lattice-binding activity mediates axon growth inhibition induced by suppression of GSK3 activity via preventing MT protrusion into the growth cone periphery, whereas the plus end-binding property supports axon extension via stabilizing the growing ends of axonal MTs. We propose a model in which CLASP transduces GSK3 activity levels to differentially control axon growth by coordinating the stability and configuration of growth cone MTs.},

The histone locus body (HLB) is an evolutionarily conserved nuclear body that regulates the transcription and processing of histone mRNAs. Here, we show that Drosophila HLBs form through phase separation. During embryogenesis, the size of HLBs is controlled in a precise and dynamic manner that is dependent on the cell cycle and zygotic histone gene activation. Control of HLB growth is achieved by a mechanism integrating nascent mRNAs at the histone locus, which facilitates phase separation, and the nuclear concentration of the scaffold protein multi-sex combs (Mxc), which is controlled by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases. Reduced Cdk2 activity results in smaller HLBs and the appearance of nascent, misprocessed histone mRNAs. Thus, our experiments identify a mechanism linking nuclear body growth and size with gene expression.},

How PRC1 engages with chromatin to identify its target genes and achieve gene repression remains poorly defined, representing a major hurdle to our understanding of Polycomb system function. Here, we use genome engineering and single particle tracking to dissect how PRC1 binds to chromatin in live mouse embryonic stem cells. We observe that PRC1 is highly dynamic, with only a small fraction stably interacting with chromatin. By integrating subunit-specific dynamics, chromatin binding, and abundance measurements, we discover that PRC1 exhibits low occupancy at target sites. Furthermore, we employ perturbation approaches to uncover how specific components of PRC1 define its kinetics and chromatin binding. Together, these discoveries provide a quantitative understanding of chromatin binding by PRC1 in live cells, suggesting that chromatin modification, as opposed to PRC1 complex occupancy, is central to gene repression.},

We found that NEAT1 facilitates the expression of antiviral genes including cytokines such as interleukin-8 (IL8). We found that splicing factor proline/glutamine-rich (SFPQ), a NEAT1-binding paraspeckle protein, is a repressor of IL8 transcription, and that NEAT1 induction relocates SFPQ from the IL8 promoter to the paraspeckles, leading to transcriptional activation of IL8. Together, our data show that NEAT1 plays an important role in the innate immune response through the transcriptional regulation of antiviral genes by the stimulus-responsive cooperative action of NEAT1 and SFPQ.},

While disruption of chromatin domains and domain boundaries can lead to misexpression of developmental genes, acute depletion of regulators of genome organization has a relatively small effect on gene expression. It is therefore uncertain whether gene expression and chromatin state drive chromatin organization or whether changes in chromatin organization facilitate cell-type-specific activation of gene expression. Here, using the dorsoventral patterning of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo as a model system, we provide evidence for the independence of chromatin organization and dorsoventral gene expression. We define tissue-specific enhancers and link them to expression patterns using single-cell RNA-seq. Surprisingly, despite tissue-specific chromatin states and gene expression, chromatin organization is largely maintained across tissues. Our results indicate that tissue-specific chromatin conformation is not necessary for tissue-specific gene expression but rather acts as a scaffold facilitating gene expression when enhancers become active.},

However, validating such candidates as bona fide enhancers requires functional characterization, typically achieved through reporter assays that test whether a sequence can increase expression of a transcriptional reporter via a minimal promoter. A longstanding concern is that reporter assays are mainly implemented on episomes, which are thought to lack physiological chromatin. However, the magnitude and determinants of differences in cis-regulation for regulatory sequences residing in episomes versus chromosomes remain almost completely unknown. To address this systematically, we developed and applied a novel lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assay (lentiMPRA) to directly compare the functional activities of 2236 candidate liver enhancers in an episomal versus a chromosomally integrated context. We find that the activities of chromosomally integrated sequences are substantially different from the activities of the identical sequences assayed on episomes, and furthermore are correlated with different subsets of ENCODE annotations. The results of chromosomally based reporter assays are also more reproducible and more strongly predictable by both ENCODE annotations and sequence-based models. With a linear model that combines chromatin annotations and sequence information, we achieve a Pearson's R2 of 0.362 for predicting the results of chromosomally integrated reporter assays. This level of prediction is better than with either chromatin annotations or sequence information alone and also outperforms predictive models of episomal assays. Our results have broad implications for how cis-regulatory elements are identified, prioritized and functionally validated.},

Knockdown of Celf3 led to the down-regulation of Gomafu, and cross-link RNA precipitation analysis confirmed specific binding between Celf3 and Gomafu. In the neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2A, Celf3 formed novel nuclear bodies (named CS bodies) that colocalized with SF1, another Gomafu-binding protein. Gomafu, however, was not enriched in the CS bodies; instead, it formed distinct nuclear bodies in separate regions in the nucleus. These observations suggest that Gomafu indirectly modulates the function of the splicing factors SF1 and Celf3 by sequestering these proteins into separate nuclear bodies.},

However, the molecular mechanisms whereby protein kinases discriminate specific substrates are still largely unknown. Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) play central roles in Ca2+ signaling in plants.

Here, we found that the variable N-terminal domain of CDPK1 is necessary for the recognition of RSG. A mutation (R10A) in the variable N-terminal domain of CDPK1 reduced both RSG binding and RSG phosphorylation while leaving kinase activity intact. Furthermore, the R10A mutation suppressed the in vivo function of CDPK1. The substitution of the variable N-terminal domain of an Arabidopsis thaliana CDPK, At CPK9, with that of Nt CDPK1 conferred RSG kinase activities. This chimeric CDPK behaved according to the identity of the variable N-terminal domain in transgenic plants. Our results open the possibility of engineering the substrate specificity of CDPK by manipulation of the variable N-terminal domain, enabling a rational rewiring of cellular signaling pathways.},

  abstract = {The cut locus is a complex gene whose function is necessary for specification of a number of cell types, including the external sensory organs. The cut wing class of mutations of the cut locus are homozygous viable and lack tissue from the wing margin, which is normally composed of external sensory organs and noninnervated bristles. Expression of cut was examined in the developing wings of wild-type and mutant pupae using an antiserum against Cut protein. Cut is expressed in all of the external sensory organs of the wing and the noninnervated bristles of the posterior margin. The cut wing class of mutations prevents Cut expression specifically in the wing margin mechanoreceptors and noninnervated bristles, apparently preventing neural differentiation. The transformed cells die soon after differentiation would have occurred. We identify an enhancer, located about 80 kb upstream of the cut gene promoter, that confers expression in the cells of the mechanoreceptors and noninnervated bristles from a heterologous promoter. The 27 gypsy retrotransposon insertions that prevent expression in these margin cells, all occur between this enhancer and the promoter. These gypsy insertions probably interfere with the interaction between the enhancer and the cut gene promoter.},

  abstract = {Establishing sites of transcription in the nuclei of higher eukaryotic cells is a very complex process. Before transcription can begin, a series of transcription factors must associate with their recognition motifs, within promoters and more remote activating sequences. Once bound, these factors and associated proteins are believed to form a complex that positions the RNA polymerase holoenzyme so that transcription can commence. As a consequence, active genes assume a specialized chromatin state across regions that define functional domains. Global nuclear architecture appears to stabilize these active domains by providing local environments dedicated to gene expression. As the spatial organization of these sites is unaffected by the removal of most chromatin they must be associated with a structural network. This nucleoskeleton, the associated transcription 'factories' and chromatin loops that arise as DNA binds proteins within factories now appear to be fundamental features of nuclear structure in higher eukaryotes. I argue that concentrating proteins needed to perform different steps of RNA synthesis within specialized nuclear compartments will be important in orchestrating events required for efficient gene expression.},

We study the proportion of self-renewal and differentiated cell lines as a function of the nucleus position, which in turn decides the plane of cleavage. Both nuclear position and noise play an important role in determining the stem cell genealogies and these results can be compared with a Markov model that ignores nucleus position. We have observed long and short genealogies from model simulation which compares well with experimental results from neuroblast and B-cell division. Symmetric cellular divisions were observed when the nucleus is apical, while asymmetric division occurs when the nucleus is towards the base.

We show that promoter interactions are highly cell type specific and enriched for links between active promoters and epigenetically marked enhancers. Promoter interactomes reflect lineage relationships of the hematopoietic tree, consistent with dynamic remodeling of nuclear architecture during differentiation. Interacting regions are enriched in genetic variants linked with altered expression of genes they contact, highlighting their functional role. We exploit this rich resource to connect non-coding disease variants to putative target promoters, prioritizing thousands of disease-candidate genes and implicating disease pathways.

In this study, we report that SALL4 expression was higher in drug resistant primary acute myeloid leukemic patients than those from drug-responsive cases. In addition, while overexpression of SALL4 led to drug resistance in cell lines, cells with decreased SALL4 expression were more sensitive to drug treatments than the parental cells. This led to our investigation of the implication of SALL4 in drug resistance and its role in side population (SP) cancer stem cells. SALL4 expression was higher in SP cells compared to non-SP cells by 2\textendash 4 fold in various malignant hematopoietic cell lines. Knocking down of SALL4 in isolated SP cells resulted in a reduction of SP cells, indicating that SALL4 is required for their self-renewal. The SP phenotype is known to be mediated by members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug transport protein family, such as ABCG2 and ABCA3. Using chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP), quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay(EMSA), we demonstrated that SALL4 was able to bind to the promoter region of ABCA3 and activate its expression while regulating the expression of ABCG2 indirectly. Furthermore, SALL4 expression was positively correlated to those of ABCG2 and ABCA3 in primary leukemic patient samples. Taken together, our results suggest a novel role for SALL4 in drug sensitivity, at least in part through the maintenance of SP cells, and therefore may be responsible for drug-resistance in leukemia. We are the first to demonstrate a direct link between stem cell factor SALL4, SP and drug resistance in leukemia.},

Recent advances in our understanding of the molecular pathways that govern the association of hypoxia with malignant tumors point to the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). The hypoxic microenvironment common to cancer cells emerges as an important factor in the induction of a pathological EMT, which is a key link in cancer progression.

However, it is unlikely that associations involving regulatory elements act in isolation of other interacting partners that also influence their impact. Indeed, the influence of multi-loci interactions remains something of an enigma as beyond low-resolution DNA FISH we do not have the appropriate tools to analyze these. Here we present a method that uses standard 4C-seq data to identify multi-loci interactions from the same cell. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method using 4C-seq data sets that identify known pairwise and novel tri-loci interactions involving the Tcrb and Igk antigen receptor enhancers. We further show that the three Igk enhancers, MiE{$\kappa$}, 3{${'}$}E{$\kappa$} and Ed{$\kappa$}, interact simultaneously in this super-enhancer cluster, which add to our previous findings showing that loss of one element decreases interactions between all three elements as well as reducing their transcriptional output. These findings underscore the functional importance of simultaneous interactions and provide new insight into the relationship between enhancer elements. Our method opens the door for studying multi-loci interactions and their impact on gene regulation in other biological settings.},

We show that when selection against deleterious alleles is weak, beneficial alleles that confer a selective advantage that is small relative to U have greatly reduced probabilities of fixation. We discuss the consequences of this effect for the distribution of effects of alleles fixed during adaptation. We show that a selective sweep will increase the fixation probabilities of other beneficial mutations arising during some short interval afterward. We use the calculated fixation probabilities to estimate the expected rate of fitness improvement in an asexual population when beneficial alleles arise continually at some low rate proportional to U. We estimate the rate of mutation that is optimal in the sense that it maximizes this rate of fitness improvement. Again, this analysis relaxes the assumption made previously that selection against deleterious alleles is stronger than on beneficial alleles.},

Activation of the heat shock response also correlates with a rapid relocalization of HSF1 within a few nuclear structures termed nuclear stress granules. These stress-induced structures, which form primarily on the 9q12 region in humans through direct binding of HSF1 to satellite III repeats, do not colocalize with transcription sites of known hsp genes. In this paper, we show that nuclear stress granules correspond to RNA polymerase II transcription factories where satellite III repeats are transcribed into large and stable RNAs that remain associated with the 9q12 region, even throughout mitosis. This work not only reveals the existence of a new major heat-induced transcript in human cells that may play a role in chromatin structure, but also provides evidence for a transcriptional activity within a locus considered so far as heterochromatic and silent.},

Coincident with these events is the rapid and reversible redistribution of HSF1 to discrete nuclear structures termed HSF1 granules, whose function is still unknown. Key features are that the number of granules correlates with cell ploidy, suggesting the existence of a chromosomal target. Here we show that in humans, HSF1 granules localize to the 9q11-q12 heterochromatic region. Within this locus, HSF1 binds through direct DNA-protein interaction with a nucleosome-containing subclass of satellite III repeats. HSF1 granule formation only requires the DNA binding competence and the trimerization of the factor. This is the first example of a transcriptional activator that accumulates transiently and reversibly on a chromosome-specific heterochromatic locus.},

This process promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). uPAR overexpression in cancer cells also promotes EMT. In this study, we tested whether uPAR may be targeted to reverse cancer cell EMT. When MDA-MB 468 breast cancer cells were cultured in 1\% O(2), uPAR expression increased, as anticipated. Cell-cell junctions were disrupted, vimentin expression increased, and E-cadherin was lost from cell surfaces, indicating EMT. Transferring these cells back to 21\% O(2) decreased uPAR expression and reversed the signs of EMT. In uPAR-overexpressing MDA-MB 468 cells, EMT was reversed by silencing expression of endogenously produced urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), which is necessary for uPAR-dependent cell signaling, or by targeting uPAR-activated cell signaling factors, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Src family kinases, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells express high levels of uPA and uPAR and demonstrate mesenchymal cell morphology under normoxic culture conditions (21\% O(2)). Silencing uPA expression in MDA-MB-231 cells decreased expression of vimentin and Snail, and induced changes in morphology characteristic of epithelial cells. These results demonstrate that uPAR-initiated cell signaling may be targeted to reverse EMT in cancer.},

  abstract = {The ability of retroviruses and transposons to insert their genetic material into host DNA makes them widely used tools in molecular biology, cancer research and gene therapy. However, these systems have biases that may strongly affect research outcomes. To address this issue, we generated very large datasets consisting of to unselected integrations in the mouse genome for the Sleeping Beauty (SB) and piggyBac (PB) transposons, and the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV). We analyzed (epi)genomic features to generate bias maps at both local and genome-wide scales. MMTV showed a remarkably uniform distribution of integrations across the genome. More distinct preferences were observed for the two transposons, with PB showing remarkable resemblance to bias profiles of the Murine Leukemia Virus. Furthermore, we present a model where target site selection is directed at multiple scales. At a large scale, target site selection is similar across systems, and defined by domain-oriented features, namely expression of proximal genes, proximity to CpG islands and to genic features, chromatin compaction and replication timing. Notable differences between the systems are mainly observed at smaller scales, and are directed by a diverse range of features. To study the effect of these biases on integration sites occupied under selective pressure, we turned to insertional mutagenesis (IM) screens. In IM screens, putative cancer genes are identified by finding frequently targeted genomic regions, or Common Integration Sites (CISs). Within three recently completed IM screens, we identified 7\%\textendash 33\% putative false positive CISs, which are likely not the result of the oncogenic selection process. Moreover, results indicate that PB, compared to SB, is more suited to tag oncogenes.},

  abstract = {Although the zebrafish has become a popular model organism for vertebrate developmental and genetic analyses, its use in transgenic studies still suffers from the scarcity of homologous gene promoters. In the present study, three different zebrafish cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced completely, and their expression patterns were characterized by whole-mount in situ hybridization as well as by Northern blot hybridization. The first clone encodes a type II cytokeratin (CK), which is specifically expressed in skin epithelia in early embryos and prominently expressed in the adult skin tissue. The second clone is muscle specific and encodes a muscle creatine kinase (MCK). The third clone, expressed ubiquitously in all tissues, is derived from an acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (arp) gene. In order to test the fidelity of zebrafish embryos in transgenic expression, the promoters of the three genes were isolated using a rapid linker-mediated PCR approach and subsequently ligated to a modified green fluorescent protein (gfp) reporter gene. When the three hybrid GFP constructs were introduced into zebrafish embryos by microinjection, the three promoters were activated faithfully in developing zebrafish embryos. The 2.2-kb ck promoter was sufficient to direct GFP expression in skin epithelia, although a weak expression in muscle was also observed in a few embryos. This pattern of transgenic expression is consistent with the expression pattern of the endogenous cytokeratin gene. The 1.5-kb mck promoter/gfp was expressed exclusively in skeletal muscles and not elsewhere. By contrast, the 0.8-kb ubiquitous promoter plus the first intron of the arp gene were capable of expressing GFP in a variety of tissues, including the skin, muscle, lens, neurons, notochord, and circulating blood cells. Our experiments, therefore, further demonstrated that zebrafish embryos can faithfully express exogenously introduced genes under the control of zebrafish promoters. Dev.

The transcription of protein-coding genes initiates at the RNA polymerase II core promoter, which is a diverse module that can be controlled by many different elements such as the TATA box and downstream core promoter element (DPE). To understand the basis for core promoter diversity, we explored potential biological functions of the DPE. We found that nearly all of the Drosophila homeotic (Hox) gene promoters, which lack TATA-box elements, contain functionally important DPE motifs that are conserved from Drosophila melanogaster to Drosophila virilis. We then discovered that Caudal, a sequence-specific transcription factor and key regulator of the Hox gene network, activates transcription with a distinct preference for the DPE relative to the TATA box. The specificity of Caudal activation for the DPE is particularly striking when a BREu core promoter motif is associated with the TATA box. These findings show that Caudal is a DPE-specific activator and exemplify how core promoter diversity can be used to establish complex regulatory networks.},

Proprioceptive sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia underwent apoptosis. The facial motor nucleus was ablated of motor neurons and contained large numbers of apoptotic bodies. Surprisingly, giant pyramidal neurons were absent in the motor cortex without any corresponding evidence of apoptosis. The epaxial and cutaneous component of dorsal ramus failed to form in the absence of the myotome.

In newborn mice, excessive amounts of adipose tissue were found in the place of muscles whose progenitor cells have undergone long-range migrations as mesenchymal cells. Analysis of the expression pattern of Myogenin-lacZ transgene and muscle proteins revealed that myogenic precursor cells were not able to acquire a myogenic fate in the trunk (myotome) nor at sites of MyoD induction in the limb buds. Importantly, the Myf5-dependent precursors, as defined by Myf5(nlacZ)-expression, deficient for both Myf5 and MyoD, were observed early in development to assume nonmuscle fates (e.g., cartilage) and, later in development, to extensively proliferate without cell death. Their fate appeared to significantly differ from the fate of MyoD-dependent precursors, as defined by 258/-2.5lacZ-expression (-20 kb enhancer of MyoD), of which a significant proportion failed to proliferate and underwent apoptosis. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that Myf5 and MyoD regulatory elements respond differentially in different compartments.},

Therefore, instead of aiming at covering all papers and considering all aspects of hormone movement, this review\textemdash still numbering more than 500 references\textemdash is restricted to three aspects of the topic: first, a brief historical sketch (Sect. 3.2); next, a consideration of the different methods used to estimate translocation and a critical evaluation of each. The section on General Remarks on Hormone Movement (Sect. 3.3), is the main theme of the review and, although there is some disadvantage in scattering results in this section, it is hoped that this is compensated far by illustrating pros and cons as well as advantages and limitations of experimental designs, and overcome by cross-referencing. The third and last section (Evidence of Hormone Translocation, Sect. 3.4) is a brief resume of the results thus far obtained in examining different types of hormone movement and hormone movement systems. Space allows neither a review of the manifold interactions between external and internal factors on hormone translocation, nor an in-depth consideration of the role of hormone distribution and its influence on patterns of growth and development, although they are occasionally referred to in different sections of this survey.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Biologistics provides data for quantitative analysis of transport (diffusion) processes and their spatio-temporal correlations in cells. Mobility of proteins is one of the few parameters necessary to describe reaction rates for gene regulation. Although understanding of diffusion-limited biochemical reactions in vivo requires mobility data for the largest possible number of proteins in their native forms, currently, there is no database that would contain the complete information about the diffusion coefficients (DCs) of proteins in a given cell type. Results: We demonstrate a method for the determination of in vivo DCs for any molecule\textemdash regardless of its molecular weight, size and structure\textemdash in any type of cell. We exemplify the method with the database of in vivo DC for all proteins (4302 records) from the proteome of K12 strain of Escherichia coli, together with examples of DC of amino acids, sugars, RNA and DNA. The database follows from the scale-dependent viscosity reference curve (sdVRC). Construction of sdVRC for prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell requires \textasciitilde 20 in vivo measurements using techniques such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or particle tracking. The shape of the sdVRC would be different for each organism, but the mathematical form of the curve remains the same. The presented method has a high predictive power, as the measurements of DCs of several inert, properly chosen probes in a single cell type allows to determine the DCs of thousands of proteins. Additionally, obtained mobility data allow quantitative study of biochemical interactions in vivo.

However, the genetic effect attributable to known loci is about 50\%, indicating that additional risk genes for LOAD remain to be identified. In this study, we have used a new GWAS data set from the University of Pittsburgh (1291 cases and 938 controls) to examine in detail the recently implicated nine new regions with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, and also performed a meta-analysis utilizing the top 1\% GWAS single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with P{$<$}0.01 along with four independent data sets (2727 cases and 3336 controls) for these SNPs in an effort to identify new AD loci. The new GWAS data were generated on the Illumina Omni1-Quad chip and imputed at \textasciitilde 2.5 million markers. As expected, several markers in the APOE regions showed genome-wide significant associations in the Pittsburg sample. While we observed nominal significant associations (P{$<$}0.05) either within or adjacent to five genes (PICALM, BIN1, ABCA7, MS4A4/MS4A6E and EPHA1), significant signals were observed 69\textendash 180 kb outside of the remaining four genes (CD33, CLU, CD2AP and CR1). Meta-analysis on the top 1\% SNPs revealed a suggestive novel association in the PPP1R3B gene (top SNP rs3848140 with P=3.05E\textendash 07). The association of this SNP with AD risk was consistent in all five samples with a meta-analysis odds ratio of 2.43. This is a potential candidate gene for AD as this is expressed in the brain and is involved in lipid metabolism. These findings need to be confirmed in additional samples.},

Although the nuclear ubiquitin ligase (E3) SCFSkp2 is implicated in p27Kip1 degradation, proteolysis of p27Kip1 at the G0\textendash G1 transition proceeds normally in Skp2-/- cells. Moreover, p27Kip1 is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm at G0\textendash G1 (refs 9\textendash 11). These data suggest the existence of a Skp2-independent pathway for the degradation of p27Kip1 at G1 phase. We now describe a previously unidentified E3 complex: KPC (Kip1 ubiquitination-promoting complex), consisting of KPC1 and KPC2. KPC1 contains a RING-finger domain, and KPC2 contains a ubiquitin-like domain and two ubiquitin-associated domains. KPC interacts with and ubiquitinates p27Kip1 and is localized to the cytoplasm. Overexpression of KPC promoted the degradation of p27Kip1, whereas a dominant-negative mutant of KPC1 delayed p27Kip1 degradation. The nuclear export of p27Kip1 by CRM1 seems to be necessary for KPC-mediated proteolysis. Depletion of KPC1 by RNA interference also inhibited p27Kip1 degradation. KPC thus probably controls degradation of p27Kip1 in G1 phase after export of the latter from the nucleus.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The mammalian genome is organised into topologically associating domains (TADs) that are formed through the process of cohesin-driven loop extrusion and whose extent is constrained at TAD boundaries by orientation-dependent CTCF binding. The large regulatory landscapes of developmental genes frequently correspond to TADs, leading to the hypothesis that TADs and/or loop extrusion are important for enhancers to act on their cognate gene. However, it has proven hard to interpret the consequences of experimental disruption of TADs or loop-extrusion on gene regulation, in part because of the difficulty in distinguishing direct from indirect effects on enhancer-driven gene expression. By coupling acute protein degradation with synthetic activation by targeted transcription factor recruitment in mouse embryonic stem cells, here we show that cohesin, but not CTCF, is required for activation of a target gene by distant distal regulatory elements. Cohesin is not required for activation directly at the promoter or activation from an enhancer located closer to the gene. Our findings support the hypothesis that chromatin compaction mediated by cohesin-mediated loop extrusion allows for genes to be activated by regulatory elements that are located many hundreds of kilobases away in the linear genome but suggests that cohesin is dispensable for more genomically close enhancers.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We report a novel pooled screening approach for a wider range of cellular and subtle subcellular phenotypes. Machine learning and convolutional neural network models are trained on the subcellular phenotype to be queried. Genome-wide screening then utilizes cells stably expressing dCas9-KRAB (CRISPRi), photoactivatable fluorescent protein (PA-mCherry), and a lentiviral guide RNA (gRNA) pool. Cells are screened by using microscopy and classified by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, which precisely identify the genetically altered phenotype. Cells with the phenotype of interest are photoactivated and isolated via flow cytometry, and the gRNAs are identified by sequencing. A proof-of-concept screen accurately identified PINK1 as essential for Parkin recruitment to mitochondria. A genome-wide screen identified factors mediating TFEB relocation from the nucleus to the cytosol upon prolonged starvation. Twenty-one of the 64 hits called by the neural network model were independently validated, revealing new effectors of TFEB subcellular localization. This approach, AI-photoswitchable screening (AI-PS), offers a novel screening platform capable of classifying a broad range of mammalian subcellular morphologies, an approach largely unattainable with current methodologies at genome-wide scale.},

It is likely that the role of Polycomb repressive complex is to dampen expression of these PRC-active genes. However, it is unclear how this flipping between chromatin states alters the kinetics of transcription. Here, we integrate histone modifications and RNAPII states derived from bulk ChIP-seq data with single-cell RNA-sequencing data. We find that Polycomb repressive complex-active genes have greater cell-to-cell variation in expression than active genes, and these results are validated by knockout experiments. We also show that PRC-active genes are clustered on chromosomes in both two and three dimensions, and interactions with active enhancers promote a stabilization of gene expression noise. These findings provide new insights into how chromatin regulation modulates stochastic gene expression and transcriptional bursting, with implications for regulation of pluripotency and development.Polycomb repressive complexes modify histones but it is unclear how changes in chromatin states alter kinetics of transcription.

Moreover, we show that only a small number of histone modifications are necessary to accurately predict gene expression. We show that different sets of histone modifications are necessary to predict gene expression driven by high CpG content promoters (HCPs) or low CpG content promoters (LCPs). Quantitative models involving H3K4me3 and H3K79me1 are the most predictive of the expression levels in LCPs, whereas HCPs require H3K27ac and H4K20me1. Finally, we show that the connections between histone modifications and gene expression seem to be general, as we were able to predict gene expression levels of one cell type using a model trained on another one.},

Recent reports highlight the fundamental roles of TGF-{$\beta$}-induced EMT in multiple aspects of cancer progression. In this review, we focus on the novel insights into the roles of TGF-{$\beta$}-induced EMT in cancer progression and the underlying mechanisms that enable TGF-{$\beta$} to activate this epithelial plasticity response at transcription, translation, and posttranslational levels. RECENT FINDINGS: Smad-mediated transcription regulation is known to activate TGF-{$\beta$}-induced EMT. More recently, novel mechanisms of epigenetic control, alternative splicing, miRNAs, translation control, and posttranslational modifications have been shown to play key roles in the control of EMT. In addition to initiating carcinoma cell invasion, TGF-{$\beta$}-induced EMT can guide cancer cells to de-differentiate and gain cancer stem-cell-like properties. EMT also allows the generation of stromal cells that support and instruct cancer progression. SUMMARY: The differentiation plasticity of epithelial cells that mediates TGF-{$\beta$}-induced EMT and reversion from mesenchymal to epithelial phenotype are increasingly seen as integral aspects of cancer progression that contribute to survival and dissemination of cancer cells. Further mechanistic insights under physiological conditions may lead to new therapeutic or prognostic strategies in cancer treatment.},

Cell Biol. 142:181-190). Evidence is now provided that microtubule contact targeting plays a role in the modulation of substrate contact dynamics. The results are derived from spreading and polarized goldfish fibroblasts in which microtubules and contact sites were simultaneously visualized using proteins conjugated with Cy-3, rhodamine, or green fluorescent protein. For cells allowed to spread in the presence of nocodazole the turnover of contacts was retarded, as compared with controls and adhesions that were retained under the cell body were dissociated after microtubule reassembly. In polarized cells, small focal complexes were found at the protruding cell front and larger adhesions, corresponding to focal adhesions, at the retracting flanks and rear. At retracting edges, multiple microtubule contact targeting preceded contact release and cell edge retraction. The same effect could be observed in spread cells, in which microtubules were allowed to reassemble after local disassembly by the application of nocodazole to one cell edge. At the protruding front of polarized cells, focal complexes were also targeted and as a result remained either unchanged in size or, more rarely, were disassembled. Conversely, when contact targeting at the cell front was prevented by freezing microtubule growth with 20 nM taxol and protrusion stimulated by the injection of constitutively active Rac, peripheral focal complexes became abnormally enlarged. We further found that the local application of inhibitors of myosin contractility to cell edges bearing focal adhesions induced the same contact dissociation and edge retraction as observed after microtubule targeting. Our data are consistent with a mechanism whereby microtubules deliver localized doses of relaxing signals to contact sites to retard or reverse their development. We propose that it is via this route that microtubules exert their well-established control on cell polarity.},

One of the major functions of microtubules is the control of polarized cell motility. In order to support the asymmetry of polarized cells, microtubules have to be organized asymmetrically themselves. Asymmetry in microtubule distribution and stability is regulated by multiple molecular factors, most of which are microtubule-associated proteins that locally control microtubule nucleation and dynamics. At the same time, the dynamic state of microtubules is key to the regulatory mechanisms by which microtubules regulate cell polarity, modulate cell adhesion and control force-production by the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we propose that even small alterations in microtubule dynamics can influence cell migration via several different microtubule-dependent pathways. We discuss regulatory factors, potential feedback mechanisms due to functional microtubule-actin crosstalk and implications for cancer cell motility.},

While defining various histone modifications and chromatin-associated proteins in multiple cell types has provided important insights into epigenetic regulation of gene expression and cellular identity, peripheral heterochromatin has not been mapped comprehensively and relatively few examples have emerged detailing the role of peripheral heterochromatin in cellular identity, cell fate choices, and/or organogenesis. In this study, we define nuclear peripheral heterochromatin organization signatures based on association with LAMIN B1 and/or dimethylation of lysine 9 on H3 (H3K9me2) across thirteen human cell types encompassing pluripotent stem cells, intermediate progenitors and differentiated cells from all three germ layers. Genomic analyses across this atlas reveal that lamin-associated chromatin is organized into at least two different compartments, defined by differences in genome coverage, chromatin accessibility, residence of transposable elements, replication timing domains, and gene complements. Our datasets reveal that only a small subset of lamin-associated chromatin domains are cell type invariant, underscoring the complexity of peripheral heterochromatin organization. Moreover, by integrating peripheral chromatin maps with transcriptional data, we find evidence of cooperative shifts between chromatin structure and gene expression associated with each cell type. This atlas of peripheral chromatin provides the largest resource to date for peripheral chromatin organization and a deeper appreciation for how this organization may impact the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Sex can be an important determinant of cancer phenotype, and exploring sex-biased tumor biology holds promise for identifying novel therapeutic targets and new approaches to cancer treatment. In an established isogenic murine model of glioblastoma, we discovered correlated transcriptome-wide sex differences in gene expression, H3K27ac marks, large Brd4-bound enhancer usage, and Brd4 localization to Myc and p53 genomic binding sites. These sex-biased gene expression patterns were also evident in human glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). These observations led us to hypothesize that Brd4-bound enhancers might underlie sex differences in stem cell function and tumorigenicity in GBM. We found that male and female GBM cells exhibited opposing responses to pharmacological or genetic inhibition of Brd4. Brd4 knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition decreased male GBM cell clonogenicity and in vivo tumorigenesis, while increasing both in female GBM cells. These results were validated in male and female patient-derived GBM cell lines. Furthermore, analysis of the Cancer Therapeutic Response Portal of human GBM samples segregated by sex revealed that male GBM cells are significantly more sensitive to BET inhibitors than are female cells. Thus, for the first time, Brd4 activity is revealed to drive a sex differences in stem cell and tumorigenic phenotype, resulting in diametrically opposite responses to BET inhibition in male and female GBM cells. This has important implications for the clinical evaluation and use of BET inhibitors.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Cancer cells within tumors display a high degree of phenotypic variability. This variability is thought to allow some of the cells to survive and persist after seemingly effective drug treatments. Studies on vemurafenib, a signaling inhibitor that targets an oncogenic BRAF mutation common in melanoma, suggested that cell-to-cell variation in drug resistance, measured by long-term proliferation, originates from epigenetic differences in gene expression that pre-exist treatment. However, it is still unknown whether reactivation of signaling downstream to the inhibited BRAF, thought to be a key step for resistance, is heterogeneous across cells. While previous studies established that signaling reactivation takes place many hours to days after treatment, they monitored reactivation with bulk-population assays unsuitable for detecting cell-to-cell heterogeneity. We hypothesized that signaling reactivation is heterogeneous and is almost instantaneous for a small subpopulation of resistant cells. We tested this hypothesis by monitoring signaling dynamics at a single-cell resolution and observed that despite highly uniform initial inhibition, roughly 15\% of cells reactivated signaling within an hour of treatment. Moreover, by tracking cell lineages over multiple days, we established that these cells indeed proliferated more than neighboring cells, thus establishing that rapid signaling reactivation predicts long-term vemurafenib resistance.},

A protocol for the generation of transgenic grapevines via biolistic transformation of embryogenic cell suspension cultures is detailed in this chapter. In a typical experiment, transient gene expression averaged nearly 8000 ``hits'' per bombarded plate. Five months after bombardment, there were nearly five putative transgenic embryos per bombarded plate. About half of the embryos were regenerated into confirmed transgenic plants. The basic bombardment procedures described are applicable to a wide range of plant genotypes, especially those for which embryogenic cell cultures are available.

In most normal cells, hypoxia stabilizes hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs), particularly HIF-1, which activates genes involved in anaerobic metabolism and angiogenesis. As hypoxia signals a cellular deprivation state, HIF-1 has also been reported to counter the activity of MYC, which encodes a transcription factor that drives cell growth and proliferation. Since many human cancers express dysregulated MYC, we sought to determine whether HIF-1 would in fact collaborate with dysregulated MYC rather countering its function. Here, using the P493-6 Burkitt's lymphoma model with an inducible MYC, we demonstrate that HIF-1 cooperates with dysregulated c-Myc to promote glycolysis by induction of hexokinase 2, which catalyzes the first step of glycolysis, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1, which inactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase and diminishes mitochondrial respiration. We also found the collaborative induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by HIF-1 and dysregulated c-Myc. This study reports the previously unsuspected collaboration between HIF-1 and dysregulated MYC and thereby provides additional insights into the regulation of VEGF and the Warburg effect, which describes the propensity for cancer cells to convert glucose to lactate.},

In the interaction of host and tumour cells, three essential phases have been proposed: elimination, equilibrium and escape, which are designated the 'three E's'. Several immune effector cells and secreted cytokines play a critical role in pursuing each process. Nascent transformed cells can initially be eliminated by an innate immune response such as by natural killer cells. During tumour progression, even though an adaptive immune response can be provoked by antigen-specific T cells, immune selection produces tumour cell variants that lose major histocompatibility complex class I and II antigens and decreases amounts of tumour antigens in the equilibrium phase. Furthermore, tumour-derived soluble factors facilitate the escape from immune attack, allowing progression and metastasis. In this review, the central roles of effector cells and cytokines in tumour immunity, and the escape mechanisms of tumour cells during tumour progression are discussed.},

The insulator protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is involved in creating boundaries that segregate chromatin and functional domains and in organizing higher-order chromatin structures by promoting chromosomal loops across the vertebrate genome. Here, we investigate the insulation properties of CTCF at the human and mouse homeobox gene A (HOXA) loci. Although cohesin loading at the CTCF binding site is required for looping, we found that cohesin is dispensable for chromatin barrier activity at that site. Using mouse embryonic stem cells in both a pluripotent and differentiated neuronal progenitor state, we determined that embryonic stem cell pluripotency factor OCT4 antagonizes cohesin loading at the CTCF binding site. Loss of OCT4 in the committed and differentiated neuronal progenitor cells results in loading of cohesin and chromosome looping, which contributes to heterochromatin partitioning and selective gene activation across the HOXA locus. Our analysis reveals that chromatin barrier activity of CTCF is evolutionarily conserved and is responsible for the coordinated establishment of chromatin structure, higher-order architecture, and developmental expression of the HOXA locus.},

Comparisons between synthetic cis-regulatory elements and genomic sequences with comparable binding site configurations revealed some aspects of a regulatory grammar. The expression of synthetic elements is influenced by both the number and arrangement of binding sites. This grammar plays only a small role for genomic sequences, as the relative activities of genomic sequences are best explained by the predicted occupancy of binding sites, regardless of binding site identity and positioning. Our results suggest that the effects of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) are influenced by the order and orientation of sites, but that in the genome the overall occupancy of TFs is the primary determinant of activity.},

In doing so, we touch on a diverse range of topics, including the identification of clinically relevant genomic variants, the modeling of transcription factor binding to DNA, the functional and evolutionary landscapes of proteins, and cis-regulatory mechanisms in both transcription and mRNA splicing. We further describe a unified conceptual framework and a core set of mathematical modeling strategies that studies in these diverse areas can make use of. Finally, we highlight key aspects of experimental design and mathematical modeling that are important for the results of such studies to be interpretable and reproducible.},

Using implanted electrodes, these fields were also shown to inhibit the growth of dermal tumors in mice. The present study extends these findings to additional cell lines [human breast carcinoma; MDA-MB-231, and human non-small-cell lung carcinoma (H1299)] and to animal tumor models (intradermal B16F1 melanoma and intracranial F-98 glioma) using external insulated electrodes. These findings led to the initiation of a pilot clinical trial of the effects of TTFields in 10 patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Median time to disease progression in these patients was 26.1 weeks and median overall survival was 62.2 weeks. These time to disease progression and OS values are more than double the reported medians of historical control patients. No device-related serious adverse events were seen after {$>$}70 months of cumulative treatment in all of the patients. The only device-related side effect seen was a mild to moderate contact dermatitis beneath the field delivering electrodes. We conclude that TTFields are a safe and effective new treatment modality which effectively slows down tumor growth in vitro, in vivo and, as demonstrated here, in human cancer patients.},

This novel treatment modality effectively inhibits the growth of solid tumors in vivo and has shown promise in pilot clinical trials in patients with advanced stage solid tumors. TTFields were tested for their potential to inhibit metastatic spread of solid tumors to the lungs in two animal models: (1) Mice injected with malignant melanoma cells (B16F10) into the tail vein, (2) New Zealand White rabbits implanted with VX-2 tumors within the kidney capsule. Mice and rabbits were treated using two-directional TTFields at 100-200 kHz. Animals were either monitored for survival, or sacrificed for pathological and histological analysis of the lungs. The total number of lung surface metastases and the absolute weight of the lungs were both significantly lower in TTFields treated mice then in sham control mice. TTFields treated rabbits survived longer than sham control animals. This extension in survival was found to be due to an inhibition of metastatic spread, seeding or growth in the lungs of TTFields treated rabbits compared to controls. Histologically, extensive peri- and intra-tumoral immune cell infiltration was seen in TTFields treated rabbits only. These results raise the possibility that in addition to their proven inhibitory effect on the growth of solid tumors, TTFields may also have clinical benefit in the prevention of metastatic spread from primary tumors.},

This effect, shown to be nonthermal, selectively affects dividing cells while quiescent cells are left intact. These fields act in two modes: arrest of cell proliferation and destruction of cells while undergoing division. Both effects are demonstrated when such fields are applied for 24 h to cells undergoing mitosis that is oriented roughly along the field direction. The first mode of action is manifested by interference with the proper formation of the mitotic spindle, whereas the second results in rapid disintegration of the dividing cells. Both effects, which are frequency dependent, are consistent with the computed directional forces exerted by these specific fields on charges and dipoles within the dividing cells. In vivo treatment of tumors in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice (B16F1 and CT-26 syngeneic tumor models, respectively), resulted in significant slowing of tumor growth and extensive destruction of tumor cells within 3-6 days. These findings demonstrate the potential applicability of the described electric fields as a novel therapeutic modality for malignant tumors.},

  abstract = {During the early process of skeletal muscle differentiation, myogenic factors are not only involved in muscle-specific gene induction but also in regulating the transition from the proliferative stage, when MyoD and Myf5 are already expressed, to the orderly exit from the cell division cycle. This key step in skeletal muscle differentiation involves the down-regulation of cell cycle activators such as cyclins and cdks, and up-regulation of cell cycle inhibitors such as Rb, p21, p27, and p57. In particular, Rb and p21 have been shown to play an important role in the growth arrest of differentiating myoblasts. Their level and/or activity, while being negatively controlled by growth factors, appear to be positively linked with the myogenic factor MyoD, which plays a cooperative role in the induction of growth arrest. MyoD can block proliferation independently of its transcriptional activity. Therefore, the interplay between G1 cyclins and cdk inhibitors, on the one hand, and MyoD and its co-factors, on the other, plays a critical role in myoblast cell cycle withdrawal. Accurate synchronization of dividing myoblasts revealed that MyoD and Myf5 are themselves subject to specific cell cycle-dependent regulation, with MyoD at its highest level in early G1 and its lowest level at the G1 to S phase transition. The time-window when cells exit their cycle into differentiation is in G1, when MyoD is maximal and Myf5 is down. In contrast, quiescent non-differentiating myoblasts (i. e., in G0) present an opposite pattern for the two factors: high Myf5 and no MyoD. Several recent studies have focused on MyoD phosphorylation and its potential role in ubiquitination-mediated degradation of the protein. Linking this phosphorylation to the cell cycle-dependent drop in MyoD protein before S phase leads, to a mechanism implying cdk2-cyclin E and its inhibitors (p57kip and p21cip) in the tight control of MyoD levels and subsequent myoblast cell cycle progression or exit into differentiation.},

How cells cope with concentration fluctuations when precision is important is unclear. Klosin et al. used a combination of theoretical and experimental work to demonstrate that phase-separated compartments can effectively reduce protein concentration noise in cells (see the Perspective by Riback and Brangwynne). The results suggest that phase separation provides a mechanism to enhance the robustness of biological systems. Science, this issue p. 464; see also p. 364 Expression of proteins inside cells is noisy, causing variability in protein concentration among identical cells. A central problem in cellular control is how cells cope with this inherent noise. Compartmentalization of proteins through phase separation has been suggested as a potential mechanism to reduce noise, but systematic studies to support this idea have been missing. In this study, we used a physical model that links noise in protein concentration to theory of phase separation to show that liquid droplets can effectively reduce noise. We provide experimental support for noise reduction by phase separation using engineered proteins that form liquid-like compartments in mammalian cells. Thus, phase separation can play an important role in biological signal processing and control. Separation of protein into liquid droplets reduces noise in protein concentration. Separation of protein into liquid droplets reduces noise in protein concentration.},

The affinity of DNA for the cations decreases in the order Ca {$>$} Mg {$>$} Na approximately K. The degree of Ca(2+) and/or Mg(2+) binding to DNA displays maximum changes just at physiological concentrations of salts (60-200 mM) and does not depend significantly on the ethanol concentration or on the kind of univalent cation (Na(+) or K(+)). Ca(2+) is more tightly bound to DNA and is replaced by the monovalent cations to a lesser extent than is Mg(2+). Similarly, Ca(2+) is a better competitor for binding to DNA than Mg(2+): the ion exchange equilibrium constant for a 1:1 mixture of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) ions, K(c)(Ca)(Mg), changes from K(c)(Ca)(Mg) approximately 2 in 65\% EtOH (in 3-30 mM NaCl and/or KCl) to K(c)(Ca)(Mg) approximately 1.2-1.4 in 52\% EtOH (in 300 mM NaCl and/or KCl). DNA does not exhibit selectivity for Na(+) or K(+) in ethanol/water solutions either in the absence or in the presence of Ca(2+) and/or Mg(2+). The ion exchange experimental data are compared with results of grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations of systems of parallel and hexagonally ordered, uniformly and discretely charged polyions with the density and spatial distribution of the charged groups modeling B DNA. A quantitative agreement with experimental data on divalent-monovalent competition has been obtained for discretely charged models of the DNA polyion (for the uniformly charged cylinder model, coincidence with experiment is qualitative). The GCMC method gives also a qualitative description of experimental results for DNA binding competitions of counterions of the same charge (Ca(2+) with Mg(2+) or K(+) with Na(+)).},

In the laboratory, and also in natural populations, loss of an enhancer can result in a loss of gene expression. Although only a few examples have been well characterized to date, some studies have suggested that an evolutionary gain of a new enhancer function can establish a new gene expression domain. Our recent study showed that Drosophila guttifera has more enhancers and additional expression domains of the wingless gene during the pupal stage, compared to D. melanogaster, and that these new features appear to have evolved in the ancestral lineage leading to D. guttifera.1 Gain of a new expression domain of a developmental regulatory gene (toolkit gene), such as wingless, can cause co-option of the expression of its downstream genes to the new domain, resulting in duplication of a preexisting structure at this new body position. Recently, with the advancement of evo-devo studies, we have learned that the developmental regulatory systems are strikingly similar across various animal taxa, in spite of the great diversity of the animals' morphology. Even behind ``new'' traits, co-options of essential developmental genes from known systems are very common. We previously provided concrete evidence of gains of enhancer activities of a developmental regulatory gene underlying gains of new traits.1 Broad occurrence of this scenario is testable and should be validated in the future.},

Here we shortly summarize the different modes of cell travelling and review in vitro methods, which can be used to evaluate migration and invasion. We provide a concise summary of established migration/invasion assays described in the literature, list advantages, limitations and drawbacks, give a tabular overview for convenience and depict the basic principles of the assays graphically. In many cases particular research problems and specific cell types do not leave a choice for a broad variety of usable assays. However, for most standard applications using adherent cells, based on our experience we suggest to use exclusion zone assays to evaluate migration/invasion. We substantiate our choice by demonstrating that the advantages outbalance the drawbacks e.g. the simple setup, the easy readout, the kinetic analysis, the evaluation of cell morphology and the feasibility to perform the assay with standard laboratory equipment. Finally, innovative 3D migration and invasion models including heterotypic cell interactions are discussed. These methods recapitulate the in vivo situation most closely. Results obtained with these assays have already shed new light on cancer cell spreading and potentially will uncover unknown mechanisms.},

According to previous data, two copies of the gypsy insulator inserted between an enhancer and a promoter neutralize each other's actions, which is indicative of an interaction between the protein complexes bound to the insulators. We have investigated the role of pairing between the gypsy insulators located on homologous chromosomes in trans interaction between yellow enhancers and a promoter. It has been shown that trans activation of the yellow promoter strongly depends on the site of the transposon insertion, which is evidence for a role of surrounding chromatin in homologous pairing. The presence of the gypsy insulators in both homologous chromosomes even at a distance of 9 kb downstream from the promoter dramatically improves the trans activation of yellow. Moreover, the gypsy insulators have proved to stabilize trans activation between distantly located enhancers and a promoter. These data suggest that gypsy insulator pairing is involved in communication between loci in the Drosophila genome.},

Here, we performed perturbation-based massively parallel reporter assays at seven early time points of neural differentiation to systematically characterize how regulatory elements and motifs within them guide cellular differentiation. By perturbing over 2,000 putative DNA binding motifs in active regulatory regions, we delineated four categories of functional elements, and observed that activity direction is mostly determined by the sequence itself, while the magnitude of effect depends on the cellular environment. We also find that fine-tuning transcription rates is often achieved by a combined activity of adjacent activating and repressing elements. Our work provides a blueprint for the sequence components needed to induce different transcriptional patterns in general and specifically during neural differentiation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The role of co-activators in establishing this long-range interaction is poorly understood. Here we tested the contributions of the RNA Pol II pre-initiation complex (PIC), mediator and cohesin to establishment of locus control region (LCR)/{$\beta$}-globin proximity. CRISPR/Cas9 editing of the {$\beta$}-globin promoter to eliminate the RNA Pol II PIC by deleting the TATA-box resulted in loss of transcription, but enhancer-promoter interaction was unaffected. Additional deletion of the promoter GATA1 site eliminated LDB1 complex and mediator occupancy and resulted in loss of LCR/{$\beta$}-globin proximity. To separate the roles of LDB1 and mediator in LCR looping, we expressed a looping-competent but transcription-activation deficient form of LDB1 in LDB1 knock down cells: LCR/{$\beta$}-globin proximity was restored without mediator core occupancy. Further, Cas9-directed tethering of mutant LDB1 to the {$\beta$}-globin promoter forced LCR loop formation in the absence of mediator or cohesin occupancy. Moreover, ENCODE data and our chromatin immunoprecipitation results indicate that cohesin is almost completely absent from validated and predicted LDB1-regulated erythroid enhancer-gene pairs. Thus, lineage specific factors largely mediate enhancer-promoter looping in erythroid cells independent of mediator and cohesin.},

Here we demonstrate that the Murine Endogenous Retroviral Element (MuERV-L/MERVL) family of transposable elements drives the 3D reorganisation of the genome in the early mouse embryo. By generating Hi-C data in 2-cell-like cells, we show that MERLV elements promote the formation of insulating domain boundaries through-out the genome in vivo and in vitro. The formation of these boundaries is coupled to the upregulation of directional transcription from MERVL, which results in the activation of a subset of the gene expression programme of the 2-cell stage embryo. Domain boundaries in the 2-cell stage embryo are transient and can be remodelled without undergoing cell division. Remarkably, we find extensive inter-strain MERVL variation, suggesting multiple non-overlapping rounds of recent genome invasion and a high regulatory plasticity of genome organisation. Our results demonstrate that MERVL drive chromatin organisation during early embryonic development shedding light into how nuclear organisation emerges during zygotic genome activation in mammals.},

We identified CTCF-dependent enhancer\textendash promoter contacts genome-wide and found that they disproportionately affect genes that are bound by CTCF at the promoter and are dependent on long-distance enhancers. Disruption of promoter-proximal CTCF binding reduced both long-range enhancer\textendash promoter contacts and transcription, which were restored by artificial tethering of CTCF to the promoter. Promoter-proximal CTCF binding is correlated with the transcription of over 2,000 genes across a diverse set of adult tissues. Taken together, the results of our study show that CTCF binding to promoters may promote long-distance enhancer-dependent transcription at specific genes in diverse cell types.},

The Drosophila gypsy insulator is proposed to establish regulatory isolation by forming loop domains that constrain interactions between transcriptional control elements. This supposition is based upon the observation that insertion of a single gypsy insulator between an enhancer and promoter blocks enhancer function, while insertion of two gypsy insulators promotes enhancer bypass and activation of transcription. To investigate this model, we determined whether non-gypsy insulators interacted with each other and with the gypsy insulator. Pairs of scs or scs{${'}$} insulators blocked enhancer function. Further, an intervening scs insulator did not block gypsy insulator interactions. Taken together, these data suggest that not all Drosophila insulators interact, with this property restricted to some insulators, such as gypsy. Three gypsy insulators inserted between an enhancer and promoter blocked enhancer function, indicating that gypsy insulator interactions may be restricted to pairs. Our studies imply that formation of loop domains may represent one of many mechanisms used by insulators to impart regulatory isolation.},

The ICR has been shown to interact physically with a silencer region in Igf2, differentially methylated region (DMR)1, but the role of CTCF in this chromatin loop and whether it restricts the physical access of distal enhancers to Igf2 is not known. We performed systematic chromosome conformation capture analyses in the Igf2/H19 region over {$>$}160 kb, identifying sequences that interact physically with the distal enhancers and the ICR. We found that, on the paternal chromosome, enhancers interact with the Igf2 promoters but that, on the maternal allele, this is prevented by CTCF binding within the H19 ICR. CTCF binding in the maternal ICR regulates its interaction with matrix attachment region (MAR)3 and DMR1 at Igf2, thus forming a tight loop around the maternal Igf2 locus, which may contribute to its silencing. Mutation of CTCF binding sites in the H19 ICR leads to loss of CTCF binding and de novo methylation of a CTCF target site within Igf2 DMR1, showing that CTCF can coordinate regional epigenetic marks. This systematic chromosome conformation capture analysis of an imprinting cluster reveals that CTCF has a critical role in the epigenetic regulation of higher-order chromatin structure and gene silencing over considerable distances in the genome.},

Decades of in vitro and yeast research have shown that the TATA-box binding protein (TBP) is essential to Pol II initiation by triggering the binding of other general transcription factors, and ensuring proper Pol II loading. Here, we report instead that acute depletion of TBP in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) has no global effect on ongoing Pol II transcription. Surprisingly, Pol II transcriptional induction through the Heat Shock Response or cellular differentiation also occurs normally in the absence of TBP. In contrast, acute TBP depletion severely impairs initiation by RNA Polymerase III. Lastly, we show that a metazoan-specific paralog of TBP is expressed in mESCs and that it binds to promoter regions of active Pol II genes even in the absence of TBP. Taken together, our findings reveal an unexplored TBP-independent process in mESCs that points to a diversity in Pol II transcription initiation mechanisms.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We aim to understand how individual nucleotides contribute to the function of CREs. Here we introduce CRE analysis by sequencing (CRE-seq), a high-throughput method for producing and testing large numbers of reporter genes in mammalian cells. We used CRE-seq to assay {$>$}1,000 single and double nucleotide mutations in a 52-bp CRE in the Rhodopsin promoter that drives strong and specific expression in mammalian photoreceptors. We find that this particular CRE is remarkably complex. The majority (86\%) of single nucleotide substitutions in this sequence exert significant effects on regulatory activity. Although changes in the affinity of known TF binding sites explain some of these expression changes, we present evidence for complex phenomena, including binding site turnover and TF competition. Analysis of double mutants revealed complex, nucleotide-specific interactions between residues in different TF binding sites. We conclude that some mammalian CREs are finely tuned by evolution and function through complex, nonadditive interactions between bound TFs. CRE-seq will be an important tool to uncover the rules that govern these interactions.},

Based on this hypothesis, the ENCODE Project Consortium measured the status of multiple histone modifications across the genome in several cell types and used these data to segment the genome into regions with different predicted regulatory activities. We measured the cis-regulatory activity of more than 2000 of these predictions in the K562 leukemia cell line. We tested genomic segments predicted to be Enhancers, Weak Enhancers, or Repressed elements in K562 cells, along with other sequences predicted to be Enhancers specific to the H1 human embryonic stem cell line (H1-hESC). Both Enhancer and Weak Enhancer sequences in K562 cells were more active than negative controls, although surprisingly, Weak Enhancer segmentations drove expression higher than did Enhancer segmentations. Lower levels of the covalent histone modifications H3K36me3 and H3K27ac, thought to mark active enhancers and transcribed gene bodies, associate with higher expression and partly explain the higher activity of Weak Enhancers over Enhancer predictions. While DNase I hypersensitivity (HS) is a good predictor of active sequences in our assay, transcription factor (TF) binding models need to be included in order to accurately identify highly expressed sequences. Overall, our results show that a significant fraction ({$\sim$}26\%) of the ENCODE enhancer predictions have regulatory activity, suggesting that histone modification states can reflect the cis-regulatory activity of sequences in the genome, but that specific sequence preferences, such as TF-binding sites, are the causal determinants of cis-regulatory activity.},

In this study, we examined the role of chromatin loops formed by two unrelated insulators, gypsy and Fab-7, in their enhancer-blocking activity. To test for this activity, we selected the white reporter gene that is activated by the eye-specific enhancer. The results showed that one copy of the gypsy or Fab-7 insulator failed to block the eye enhancer in most of genomic sites, whereas a chromatin loop formed by two gypsy insulators flanking either the eye enhancer or the reporter completely blocked white stimulation by the enhancer. However, strong enhancer blocking was achieved due not only to chromatin loop formation but also to the direct interaction of the gypsy insulator with the eye enhancer, which was confirmed by the 3C assay. In particular, it was observed that Mod(mdg4)-67.2, a component of the gypsy insulator, interacted with the Zeste protein, which is critical for the eye enhancer\textendash white promoter communication. These results suggest that efficient enhancer blocking depends on the combination of two factors: chromatin loop formation by paired insulators, which generates physical constraints for enhancer\textendash promoter communication, and the direct interaction of proteins recruited to an insulator and to the enhancer\textendash promoter pair.},

Furthermore, for both common and rare variants, it is expected that only a subset fraction will affect gene expression. Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs) are molecular genetic tools that enable functional screening of hundreds of predefined sequences in a single experiment. These assays have been used for functional screening of several different types of regulatory sequences in vitro. However, they have not yet been adapted to query specific cell types in vivo in a complex tissue like the mouse brain. Here, using a test-case 3{${'}$}UTR MPRA library with variants from ASD patients, we sought to develop a method to achieve reproducible measurements of variant effects in vivo in a cell type-specific manner. We implemented a Cre-dependent design to control expression of our library and first validated our system in vitro. Next, we measured the effect of {$>$}500 3{${'}$}UTR variants in excitatory neurons in the mouse brain. Finally, we report {$>$}40 variants with significant effects on transcript abundance in the context of the brain. This new technique should enable robust, functional annotation of genetic variants in the cellular contexts most relevant to psychiatric disease.},

Tissue-specific screening of in vivo enhancer function at scale has the potential to greatly expand our understanding of the role of non-coding sequences in development, evolution, and disease. Here, we adapted a self-transcribing regulatory element MPRA strategy for delivery to early postnatal mouse brain via recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). We identified and validated putative enhancers capable of driving reporter gene expression in mouse forebrain, including regulatory elements within an intronic CACNA1C linkage disequilibrium block associated with risk in neuropsychiatric disorder genetic studies.

We demonstrate that sensitivity of gene expression to mutations increases with both increasing trans-mutational target size and the presence of a TATA box. Genes with greater sensitivity to mutations are also more sensitive to systematic environmental perturbations and stochastic noise. These results provide a mechanistic basis for gene expression evolvability that can serve as a foundation for realistic models of regulatory evolution.},

Indeed, many of first-line therapeutic regimens currently in use for the treatment of human cancer are designed to target cancer cells (such as chemotherapy) and also to modulate the tumor microenvironment (such as anti-angiogenic therapy). While some types of tumors are capable of forming metastases in virtually every organ in the body, the most frequent target organs of metastasis are bone, brain, liver, and the lung.

Elevating cytokinin levels was observed to disrupt lateral root initiation and the regular pattern of divisions that characterizes lateral root development in Arabidopsis. To identify the stage of lateral root development that is sensitive to cytokinins, we targeted the expression of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens cytokinin biosynthesis enzyme isopentenyltransferase to either xylem-pole pericycle cells or young lateral root primordia using GAL4-GFP enhancer trap lines. Transactivation experiments revealed that xylem-pole pericycle cells are sensitive to cytokinins, whereas young lateral root primordia are not. This effect is physiologically significant because transactivation of the Arabidopsis cytokinin degrading enzyme cytokinin oxidase 1 in lateral root founder cells results in increased lateral root formation. We observed that cytokinins perturb the expression of PIN genes in lateral root founder cells and prevent the formation of an auxin gradient that is required to pattern lateral root primordia.},

Here we determine transcriptome-wide burst frequencies and sizes for endogenous mouse and human genes using allele-sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing. We show that core promoter elements affect burst size and uncover synergistic effects between TATA and initiator elements, which were masked at mean expression levels. Notably, we provide transcriptome-wide evidence that enhancers control burst frequencies, and demonstrate that cell-type-specific gene expression is primarily shaped by changes in burst frequencies. Together, our data show that burst frequency is primarily encoded in enhancers and burst size in core promoters, and that allelic single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful model for investigating transcriptional kinetics.},

  abstract = {Epithelial\textendash mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important process during development by which epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal, fibroblast-like properties and show reduced intercellular adhesion and increased motility. Accumulating evidence points to a critical role of EMT-like events during tumor progression and malignant transformation, endowing the incipient cancer cell with invasive and metastatic properties. Several oncogenic pathways (peptide growth factors, Src, Ras, Ets, integrin, Wnt/-catenin and Notch) induce EMT and a critical molecular event is the downregulation of the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin. Recently, activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3K)/AKT axis is emerging as a central feature of EMT. In this review, we discuss the role of PI3K/AKT pathways in EMT during development and cancer with a focus on E-cadherin regulation. Interactions between PI3K/AKT and other EMT-inducing pathways are presented, along with a discussion of the therapeutic implications of modulating EMT in order to achieve cancer control.},

Second, mobility-shift assays of muscle cell nuclear extracts, "double shifted" with specific antisera, have identified complexes binding to the MEF1 site that contain either MyoD or myogenin in association with E12/E47-like proteins. Third, association with E47 alters the phosphorylation state of MyoD. Fourth, C3H10T1/2 cells expressing antisense E2A transcripts contain low levels of E2A gene products and display less terminal muscle differentiation when infected with retroviral MyoD or when challenged to differentiate with 5-azacytidine treatment. In addition we demonstrate that MyoD, in conjunction with E12/E47-like proteins, is functioning as a regulatory nodal point for activation of several other downstream muscle regulators.},

These histone proteins have tails that project from the nucleosome and many residues in these tails can be post-translationally modified, influencing all DNA-based processes, including chromatin compaction, nucleosome dynamics, and transcription. In contrast to those present in histone tails, modifications in the core regions of the histones had remained largely uncharacterised until recently, when some of these modifications began to be analysed in detail. Overall, recent work has shown that histone core modifications can not only directly regulate transcription, but also influence processes such as DNA repair, replication, stemness, and changes in cell state. In this review, we focus on the most recent developments in our understanding of histone modifications, particularly those on the lateral surface of the nucleosome. This region is in direct contact with the DNA and is formed by the histone cores. We suggest that these lateral surface modifications represent a key insight into chromatin regulation in the cell. Therefore, lateral surface modifications form a key area of interest and a focal point of ongoing study in epigenetics.},

Our images reveal that blood vessels undergoing active angiogenic growth display extensive filopodial activity and pathfinding behavior similar to that of neuronal growth cones. We further show, using the zebrafish mindbomb mutant as an example, that the expression of EGFP within developing blood vessels permits detailed analysis of vascular defects associated with genetic mutations. Thus, these transgenic lines allow detailed analysis of both wild type and mutant embryonic vasculature and, together with the ability to perform large scale forward-genetic screens in zebrafish, will facilitate identification of new mutants affecting vascular development.},

To this end, we generated specific antibodies (Abs) against domain 1 (D1) and domain 3 (D3) of HER3 that recognize epitopes that do not overlap with the neuregulin-binding site. The fully human H4B-121 Ab and the mouse monoclonal Abs 16D3-C1 and 9F7-F11 inhibited tumor growth in nude mice xenografted with epidermoid, pancreatic, or triple-negative breast cancer cells. The combination of one anti-HER3 Ab and trastuzumab improved tumor growth inhibition in mice xenografted with HER2 cancer cell lines, for which trastuzumab alone shows no or moderate efficiency. Ab-induced disruption of tumor growth was associated with G cell cycle arrest, proliferation inhibition, and apoptosis of cancer cells. Anti-HER3 Abs blocked HER2/HER3 heterodimerization and HER3 phosphorylation at the cell membrane, leading to inhibition of phosphorylation of the downstream AKT targets murine double minute 2, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, and forkhead box O1. This study demonstrates that anti-HER3 D1 and D3 Abs could represent a new option for immunotherapy of pancreatic and triple-negative breast cancers.},

This study was undertaken to investigate whether PI 3-kinase participates in cell cycle regulation in response to stimulation with FGF-2 in CECs. methods. Cell proliferation was assayed by counting the cells. Subcellular localization of proteins was determined by immunofluorescent staining and expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4), p27Kip1 (p27), phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI 3)-kinase, protein kinase B/Akt (Akt), and {$\beta$}-actin was analyzed by immunoblot. PI 3-kinase activity was determined by measuring production of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate. LY294002 was used to inhibit PI 3-kinase. results. CEC required prolonged and continuous exposure to FGF-2. FGF-2 at 10 ng/mL markedly stimulated PI 3-kinase enzyme activity, and stimulation with FGF-2 also caused activation of Akt. LY294002 inhibited both cell proliferation and PI 3-kinase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The role of PI 3-kinase in cell cycle stimulation was determined: FGF-2 markedly upregulated expression of Cdk4 and stimulated translocation of Cdk4 into nuclei, whereas LY294002 markedly blocked upregulation of Cdk4 expression, and the inhibitor facilitated nuclear export of Cdk4. In contrast, FGF-2 significantly downregulated expression of p27 and facilitated phosphorylation of p27. LY294002 completely blocked the action of FGF-2 on the expression and phosphorylation of p27. conclusions. These data indicate that PI 3-kinase ultimately leads to activation of the cell cycle machinery in response to FGF-2. It does so by upregulating expression of Cdk4, facilitating the nuclear import of Cdk4, and sequestering Cdk4 in the nuclei as it simultaneously downregulates expression of p27 and facilitates the proteolysis of the molecule by phosphorylation.},

We investigated whether FGF-2 uses PI 3-kinase to facilitate phosphorylation of p27 on serine 10 (Ser-10) and threonine 187 (Thr-187) and whether the two phosphorylation sites were differentially regulated. FGF-2 stimulation dramatically increased p27 phosphorylation at Ser-10 and Thr-187 using differential kinetics, and the FGF-2-induced p27 phosphorylation was completely blocked at both sites by LY294002. We determined the physical and biochemical interaction of p27 with the Cdk2-cyclin E complex in response to FGF-2 stimulation. Maximal p27 binding to Cdk2-cyclin E occurred at 12 h; the maximal level of p27 phosphorylation at Thr-187 in the ternary complex was observed at 16 h; ubiquitination of the Thr-187-phosphorylated p27 (pp27Thr-187) was observed starting at 12 h and continuing up to 24 h. However, maximum p27 phosphorylation at Ser-10 occurred in the nucleus 6 h after FGF-2 stimulation; maximal export of Ser-10-phosphorylated p27 (pp27Ser-10) occurred 8 h after FGF-2 treatment, and pp27Ser-10 was simultaneously ubiquitinated. We further investigated which of the two phosphorylated p27 was involved in G1/S progression. LY294002 blocked 64\% of the cell proliferation stimulated by FGF-2. Use of leptomycin B to block nuclear export of pp27Ser-10 greatly decreased the FGF-2-stimulated cell proliferation (44\%), suggesting that phosphorylation of p27 at Ser-10 is the major mechanism for G1/S transition. Our results suggest that differential kinetics are observed in p27 phosphorylation at Ser-10 and Thr-187 and that pp27Thr-187 and pp27Ser-10 may represent two populations of p27 observed in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.},

We show that hundreds of human promoters become active when moved from their native LAD position to a neutral context in the same cells, indicating that LADs form a repressive environment. Another set of promoters inside LADs is able to ``escape'' repression, although their transcription elongation is attenuated. By inserting reporters into thousands of genomic locations, we demonstrate that escaper promoters are intrinsically less sensitive to LAD repression. This is not simply explained by promoter strength but by the interplay between promoter sequence and local chromatin features that vary strongly across LADs. Enhancers also differ in their sensitivity to LAD chromatin. This work provides a general framework for the systematic understanding of gene regulation by repressive chromatin.},

In this review, we break down several critical steps, emphasizing new data and techniques that have expanded current gene regulatory models. We begin at the level of DNA sequence where cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) provide important regulatory information in the form of transcription factor (TF) binding sites. In this respect, CRMs function as instructional platforms for the assembly of gene regulatory complexes. We discuss multiple mechanisms controlling complex assembly, including cooperative DNA binding, combinatorial codes, and CRM architecture. The second section of this review places CRM assembly in the context of nucleosomes and condensed chromatin. We discuss how DNA accessibility and histone modifications contribute to TF function. Lastly, new advances in chromosomal mapping techniques have provided increased understanding of intra- and interchromosomal interactions. We discuss how these topological maps influence gene regulatory models.},

  abstract = {In mammalian cells genes that are in close proximity can be transcriptionally coupled: silencing or activating one gene can affect its neighbors. Understanding these dynamics is important for natural processes, such as heterochromatin spreading during development and aging, and when designing synthetic gene regulation circuits. Here, we systematically dissect this process in single cells by recruiting and releasing repressive chromatin regulators at dual-gene synthetic reporters, and measuring how fast gene silencing and reactivation spread as a function of intergenic distance and configuration of insulator elements. We find that silencing by KRAB, associated with histone methylation, spreads between two genes within hours, with a time delay that increases with distance. This fast KRAB-mediated spreading is not blocked by the classical cHS4 insulators. Silencing by histone deacetylase HDAC4 of the upstream gene can also facilitate background silencing of the downstream gene by PRC2, but with a days-long delay that does not change with distance. This slower silencing can sometimes be stopped by insulators. Gene reactivation of neighboring genes is also coupled, with strong promoters and insulators determining the order of reactivation. Our data can be described by a model of multi-gene regulation that builds upon previous knowledge of heterochromatin spreading, where both gene silencing and gene reactivation can act at a distance, allowing for coordinated dynamics via chromatin regulator recruitment.},

Genetic analysis of Ssq reveals that the Lmbr1 gene is incidental to the phenotype and that the mutation directly interrupts a cis-acting regulator of Shh.

The Cdc42/Rac-binding p21-activated kinase (PAK) and Rho-binding kinase (ROK) act as morphological effectors for these GTPases. We have isolated two related novel brain kinases whose p21-binding domains resemble that of PAK whereas the kinase domains resemble that of myotonic dystrophy kinase-related ROK. These {$\sim$}190-kDa myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinases (MRCKs) preferentially phosphorylate nonmuscle myosin light chain at serine 19, which is known to be crucial for activating actin-myosin contractility. The p21-binding domain binds GTP-Cdc42 but not GDP-Cdc42. The multidomain structure includes a cysteine-rich motif resembling those of protein kinase C andn-chimaerin and a putative pleckstrin homology domain. MRCK{$\alpha$} and Cdc42V12 colocalize, particularly at the cell periphery in transfected HeLa cells. Microinjection of plasmid encoding MRCK{$\alpha$} resulted in actin and myosin reorganization. Expression of kinase-dead MRCK{$\alpha$} blocked Cdc42V12-dependent formation of focal complexes and peripheral microspikes. This was not due to possible sequestration of the p21, as a kinase-dead MRCK{$\alpha$} mutant defective in Cdc42 binding was an equally effective blocker. Coinjection of MRCK{$\alpha$} plasmid with Cdc42 plasmid, at concentrations where Cdc42 plasmid by itself elicited no effect, led to the formation of the peripheral structures associated with a Cdc42-induced morphological phenotype. These Cdc42-type effects were not promoted upon coinjection with plasmids of kinase-dead or Cdc42-binding-deficient MRCK{$\alpha$} mutants. These results suggest that MRCK{$\alpha$} may act as a downstream effector of Cdc42 in cytoskeletal reorganization.},

Inducing collagen crosslinking stiffened the ECM, promoted focal adhesions, enhanced PI3 Kinase (PI3K) activity, and induced the invasion of an oncogene-initiated epithelium. Inhibiting integrin signaling repressed the invasion of a premalignant epithelium into a stiffened, crosslinked ECM, and forced integrin clustering promoted focal adhesions, enhanced PI3K signaling and induced the invasion of a premalignant epithelium. Consistently, reducing lysyl oxidase-mediated collagen crosslinking prevented MMTV-Neu-induced fibrosis, decreased focal adhesions and PI3K activity, impeded malignancy and lowered tumor incidence. These data show how collagen crosslinking can modulate tissue fibrosis and stiffness to force focal adhesions, growth factor signaling and breast malignancy.},

Critical enhancers are sometimes even found within the introns of neighboring genes. This review summarizes well-defined examples of enhancers controlling key processes in animal development. Potential mechanisms of transcriptional synergy are discussed with regard to enhancer structure and contemporary ChIP-sequencing assays, whereby just a small fraction of the observed binding sites represent bona fide regulatory DNAs.

A major emerging theme is the central importance of the interplay between auxin signalling and the active transport of auxin through the plant to create dynamic patterns of auxin accumulation. Even in tissues where auxin distribution patterns appear stable, they are the product of standing waves, with auxin flowing through the tissue, maintaining local pockets of high and low concentration. The auxin distribution patterns result in changes in gene expression to trigger diverse, context-dependent growth and differentiation responses. Multi-level feedback loops between the signal transduction network and the auxin transport network provide self-stabilising patterns that remain sensitive to the external environment and to the developmental progression of the plant. The full biological implications of the behaviour of this system are only just beginning to be understood through a combination of experimental manipulation and mathematical modelling.},

  abstract = {Aggressive cancers and embryonic stem (ES) cells share a common gene expression signature. Identifying the key factors/pathway(s) within this ES signature responsible for the aggressiveness of cancers can lead to a potential cure. In this study, we find that SALL4, a gene involved in the maintenance of ES cell self-renewal, is aberrantly expressed in 47.7\% of primary human endometrial cancer samples. It is not expressed in normal or hyperplastic endometrial. More importantly, SALL4 expression is positively correlated with worse patient survival and aggressive features such as metastasis in endometrial carcinoma. Further functional studies have shown that loss of SALL4 inhibits endometrial cancer cell growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo, as a result of inhibition of cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. In addition, downregulation of SALL4 significantly impedes the migration and invasion properties of endometrial cancer cells in vitro and their metastatic potential in vivo. Furthermore, manipulation of SALL4 expression can affect drug sensitivity of endometrial cancer cells to carboplatin. Moreover, we show that SALL4 specifically binds to the c-Myc promoter region in endometrial cancer cells. While downregulation of SALL4 leads to a decreased expression of c-Myc at both protein and mRNA levels, ectopic SALL4 overexpression causes increased c-Myc protein and mRNA expression, indicating that c-Myc is one of the SALL4 downstream targets in endometrial tumorigenesis. In summary, we are the first to demonstrate that SALL4 has functional role(s) in metastasis and drug resistance in aggressive endometrial cancer. As a consequence of its functional roles in cancer cell and absence in normal tissue, SALL4 is a potential novel therapeutic target for the high-risk endometrial cancer patient population.},

To identify candidate proteins that mediate the Glu microtubule-vimentin interaction, we incubated microtubules with microtubule-interacting proteins and saturating levels of antibodies to Glu or tyrosinated (Tyr) tubulin. Antibodies to Glu tubulin prevented the microtubule binding of kinesin obtained from fibroblast or brain extracts more effectively than antibodies to Tyr tubulin. Scatchard plot analysis showed that kinesin heads bound to Glu microtubules with an approximately 2.8-fold higher affinity than to Tyr microtubules. Purified brain kinesin cosedimented with vimentin, but not with neurofilaments, indicating that kinesin specifically associates with vimentin without accessory molecules. Kinesin binding to vimentin was not sensitive to ATP, and kinesin heads failed to bind to vimentin. By SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a kinesin heavy chain of approximately 120 kDa and a light chain of approximately 64 kDa were detected in vimentin/kinesin pellets. The light chain reacted with a general kinesin light chain antibody, but not with two other antibodies that recognize the two known isoforms of kinesin light chain in brain, suggesting that the kinesin involved in binding to vimentin may be a specific one. These results demonstrate a kinesin-based mechanism for the preferential interaction of vimentin with detyrosinated microtubules.},

  abstract = {Due to the self-propagating nature of the heterochromatic modification H3K27me3, chromatin barrier activities are required to demarcate the boundary and prevent it from encroaching into euchromatic regions. Studies in Drosophila and vertebrate systems have revealed several important chromatin barrier elements and their respective binding factors. However, epigenomic data indicate that the binding of these factors are not exclusive to chromatin boundaries. To gain a comprehensive understanding of facultative heterochromatin boundaries, we developed a two-tiered method to identify the Chromatin Transitional Region (CTR), i.e. the nucleosomal region that shows the greatest transition rate of the H3K27me3 modification as revealed by ChIP-Seq. This approach was applied to identify CTRs in Drosophila S2 cells and human HeLa cells. Although many insulator proteins have been characterized in Drosophila, less than half of the CTRs in S2 cells are associated with known insulator proteins, indicating unknown mechanisms remain to be characterized. Our analysis also revealed that the peak binding of insulator proteins are usually 1\textendash 2 nucleosomes away from the CTR. Comparison of CTR-associated insulator protein binding sites vs. those in heterochromatic region revealed that boundary-associated binding sites are distinctively flanked by nucleosome destabilizing sequences, which correlates with significant decreased nucleosome density and increased binding intensities of co-factors. Interestingly, several subgroups of boundaries have enhanced H3.3 incorporation but reduced nucleosome turnover rate. Our genome-wide study reveals that diverse mechanisms are employed to define the boundaries of facultative heterochromatin. In both Drosophila and mammalian systems, only a small fraction of insulator protein binding sites co-localize with H3K27me3 boundaries. However, boundary-associated insulator binding sites are distinctively flanked by nucleosome destabilizing sequences, which correlates with significantly decreased nucleosome density and increased binding of co-factors.},

  abstract = {Motivation: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows\textendash Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is {$\sim$}10\textendash 20\texttimes{} faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.Availability:http://maq.sourceforge.netContact:rd@sanger.ac.uk},

Here we describe CRISPR/dCas9-based enhancer-targeting epigenetic editing systems, enCRISPRa and enCRISPRi, for efficient analysis of enhancer function in situ and in vivo. Using dual effectors capable of re-writing enhancer-associated chromatin modifications, we show that enCRISPRa and enCRISPRi modulate gene transcription by remodeling local epigenetic landscapes at sgRNA-targeted enhancers and associated genes. Comparing with existing methods, the improved systems display more robust perturbations of enhancer activity and gene transcription with minimal off-targets. Allele-specific targeting of enCRISPRa to oncogenic TAL1 super-enhancer modulates TAL1 expression and cancer progression in xenotransplants. Single or multi-loci perturbations of lineage-specific enhancers using an enCRISPRi knock-in mouse establish in vivo evidence for lineage-restricted essentiality of developmental enhancers during hematopoiesis. Hence, enhancer-targeting CRISPR epigenetic editing provides opportunities for interrogating enhancer function in native biological contexts.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Proper development depends on precise spatiotemporal gene expression patterns. Most genes are regulated by multiple enhancers and often by multiple core promoters that generate similar transcripts. We hypothesize that these multiple promoters may be required either because enhancers prefer a specific promoter or because multiple promoters serve as a redundancy mechanism. To test these hypotheses, we studied the expression of the \emph{knirps} locus in the early \emph{Drosophila melanogaster} embryo, which is mediated by multiple enhancers and core promoters. We found that one of these promoters resembles a typical ``sharp'' developmental promoter, while the other resembles a ``broad'' promoter usually associated with housekeeping genes. Using synthetic reporter constructs, we found that some, but not all, enhancers in the locus show a preference for one promoter. By analyzing the dynamics of these reporters, we identified specific burst properties during the transcription process, namely burst size and frequency, that are most strongly tuned by the specific combination of promoter and enhancer. Using locus-sized reporters, we discovered that even enhancers that show no promoter preference in a synthetic setting have a preference in the locus context. Our results suggest that the presence of multiple promoters in a locus is both due to enhancer preference and a need for redundancy and that ``broad'' promoters with dispersed transcription start sites are common among developmental genes. Our results also imply that it can be difficult to extrapolate expression measurements from synthetic reporters to the locus context, where many variables shape a gene's overall expression pattern.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The MTE promotes transcription by RNA polymerase II when it is located precisely at positions +18 to +27 relative to A+1 in the initiator (Inr) element. MTE sequences from +18 to +22 relative to A+1 are important for basal transcription, and a region from +18 to +27 is sufficient to confer MTE activity to heterologous core promoters. The MTE requires the Inr, but functions independently of the TATA-box and DPE. Notably, the loss of transcriptional activity upon mutation of a TATA-box or DPE can be compensated by the addition of an MTE. In addition, the MTE exhibits strong synergism with the TATA-box as well as the DPE. These findings indicate that the MTE is a novel downstream core promoter element that is important for transcription by RNA polymerase II.},

Here we demonstrate that a single transcription factor is able to regulate distinct core circuitries in two different blastocyst-derived stem cell lines, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and extraembryonic endoderm (XEN) cells. The transcription factor Sall4 is required for early embryonic development and for ESC pluripotency. Sall4 is also expressed in XEN cells, and depletion of Sall4 disrupts self-renewal and induces differentiation. Genome-wide analysis reveals that Sall4 is regulating different gene sets in ESCs and XEN cells, and depletion of Sall4 targets in the respective cell types induces differentiation. With Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, Sall4 forms a crucial interconnected autoregulatory network in ESCs. In XEN cells, Sall4 regulates the key XEN lineage-associated genes Gata4, Gata6, Sox7, and Sox17. Our findings demonstrate how Sall4 functions as an essential stemness factor for two different stem cell lines.},

In this study, we investigated the possible role of a novel protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) family member, PP2C{$\epsilon$}, in the regulation of the IL-1-TAK1 signaling pathway. PP2C{$\epsilon$} was composed of 303 amino acids, and the overall similarity of amino acid sequence between PP2C{$\epsilon$} and PP2C{$\alpha$} was found to be 26\%. Ectopic expression of PP2C{$\epsilon$} inhibited the IL-1- and TAK1-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4)-c-Jun N-terminal kinase or MKK3-p38 signaling pathway. PP2C{$\epsilon$} dephosphorylated TAK1 in vitro. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that PP2C{$\epsilon$} associates stably with TAK1 and attenuates the binding of TAK1 to MKK4 or MKK6. Ectopic expression of a phosphatase-negative mutant of PP2C{$\epsilon$}, PP2C{$\epsilon$}(D/A), which acted as a dominant negative form, enhanced both the association between TAK1 and MKK4 or MKK6 and the TAK1-induced activation of an AP-1 reporter gene. The association between PP2C{$\epsilon$} and TAK1 was transiently suppressed by IL-1 treatment of the cells. Taken together, these results suggest that, in the absence of IL-1-induced signal, PP2C{$\epsilon$} contributes to keeping the TAK1 signaling pathway in an inactive state by associating with and dephosphorylating TAK1.},

  abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic modifications play crucial roles in the regulation of gene expression, and correlations between the two types of factors have been discovered. However, methods for quantitatively studying the correlations remain limited. Here, we present a computational approach to systematically investigating how epigenetic changes in chromatin architectures or DNA sequences relate to TF binding. We implemented statistical analyses to illustrate that epigenetic modifications are predictive of TF binding affinities, without the need of sequence information. Intriguingly, by considering genome locations relative to transcription start sites (TSSs) or enhancer midpoints, our analyses show that different locations display various relationship patterns. For instance, H3K4me3, H3k9ac and H3k27ac contribute more in the regions near TSSs, whereas H3K4me1 and H3k79me2 dominate in the regions far from TSSs. DNA methylation plays relatively important roles when close to TSSs than in other regions. In addition, the results show that epigenetic modification models for the predictions of TF binding affinities are cell line-specific. Taken together, our study elucidates highly coordinated, but location- and cell type-specific relationships between epigenetic modifications and binding affinities of TFs.},

Many RNA-seq studies have used insufficient biological replicates, resulting in low statistical power and inefficient use of sequencing resources. RESULTS: We show the explicit trade-off between more biological replicates and deeper sequencing in increasing power to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes. In the human cell line MCF7, adding more sequencing depth after 10 M reads gives diminishing returns on power to detect DE genes, whereas adding biological replicates improves power significantly regardless of sequencing depth. We also propose a cost-effectiveness metric for guiding the design of large-scale RNA-seq DE studies. Our analysis showed that sequencing less reads and performing more biological replication is an effective strategy to increase power and accuracy in large-scale differential expression RNA-seq studies, and provided new insights into efficient experiment design of RNA-seq studies.

While gsb is a segment-polarity gene and mainly expressed in the epidermis, gsbn is expressed in the central nervous system. An intriguing question is how their transcriptional specificity arises. Here we show that different non-overlapping enhancer or upstream control elements drive the specific expression of gsb and gsbn. Specificity of these enhancers for their genes is achieved by their inability to activate transcription in combination with the heterologous promoter of the other gene. These results therefore suggest that compatibility between the enhancer and its cognate promoter is a mechanism ensuring transcriptional specificity.},

That yielded additional atlases of long noncoding RNAs, miRNAs and their promoters. We have also expanded the CAGE analysis to cover rat, dog, chicken, and macaque species for a limited number of cell types. The CAGE data obtained from human and mouse were reprocessed to make them available on the latest genome assemblies.

The youngest leaves analysed, less than 0.5 mm in length, contained 250 pg mg(-1) of IAA and also exhibited the highest relative capacity to synthesize this hormone. A decrease of nearly one hundred-fold in IAA content occurred as the young leaves expanded to their full size, and this was accompanied by a clear shift in both pool size and IAA synthesis capacity. The correlation between high IAA content and intense cell division was further verified in tobacco leaves, where a detailed analysis revealed that dividing mesophyll tissue contained ten-fold higher IAA levels than tissue growing solely by elongation. We demonstrated that all parts of the young Arabidopsis plant can potentially contribute to the auxin needed for growth and development, as not only young leaves, but also all other parts of the plant such as cotyledons, expanding leaves and root tissues have the capacity to synthesize IAA de novo. We also observed that naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) treatment induced tissue-dependent feedback inhibition of IAA biosynthesis in expanding leaves and cotyledons, but intriguingly not in young leaves or in the root system. This observation supports the hypothesis that there is a sophisticated tissue-specific regulatory mechanism for auxin biosynthesis. Finally, a strict requirement for maintaining the pool sizes of IAA was revealed as reductions in leaf expansion followed both decreases and increases in the IAA levels in developing leaves. This indicates that leaves are not only important sources for IAA synthesis, but that normal leaf expansion depends on rigorous control of IAA homeostasis.},

Using a metabolomics approach with isotope labeling, we found that in some cancer cells a relatively large amount of glycolytic carbon is diverted into serine and glycine metabolism through phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH). An analysis of human cancers showed that PHGDH is recurrently amplified in a genomic region of focal copy number gain most commonly found in melanoma. Decreasing PHGDH expression impaired proliferation in amplified cell lines. Increased expression was also associated with breast cancer subtypes, and ectopic expression of PHGDH in mammary epithelial cells disrupted acinar morphogenesis and induced other phenotypic alterations that may predispose cells to transformation. Our findings show that the diversion of glycolytic flux into a specific alternate pathway can be selected during tumor development and may contribute to the pathogenesis of human cancer.},

To elucidate the direct effects of MMPs on mammary epithelium, we generated functionally normal cells expressing an inducible autoactivating stromelysin-1 (SL-1) transgene. Induction of SL-1 expression resulted in cleavage of E-cadherin, and triggered progressive phenotypic conversion characterized by disappearance of E-cadherin and catenins from cell-cell contacts, downregulation of cytokeratins, upregulation of vimentin, induction of keratinocyte growth factor expression and activation, and upregulation of endogenous MMPs. Cells expressing SL-1 were unable to undergo lactogenic differentiation and became invasive. Once initiated, this phenotypic conversion was essentially stable, and progressed even in the absence of continued SL-1 expression. These observations demonstrate that inappropriate expression of SL-1 initiates a cascade of events that may represent a coordinated program leading to loss of the differentiated epithelial phenotype and gain of some characteristics of tumor cells. Our data provide novel insights into how MMPs function in development and neoplastic conversion.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional initiator (Inr) elements, like TATA boxes, are found in the core promoters of many eukaryotic protein-coding genes. To facilitate the dissection of transcription initiation mechanisms, and to identify Inr elements within known and newly-discovered genes, the precise DNA sequence requirements for Inr activity must be defined. Previously, we reported a preliminary Inr consensus sequence based on an extensive mutant analysis carried out in HeLa cell extracts. This analysis was limited, however, because it was performed only with an in vitro transcription assay and with the mutants in only one promoter context. In this study, we have assessed the general validity of the functional Inr consensus sequence by analyzing a selected set of mutants in additional promoter contexts and with both in vivo and in vitro assays. In addition, we analyzed the evolutionary conservation of the Inr consensus sequence by determining the sequence requirements for Inr function in Drosophila embryo extracts. The results demonstrate the generality and strict conservation among vertebrates and invertebrates of the Inr consensus sequence, Py Py A+1 N T/A Py Py.},

The EMT is a crucial process in the development of different tissues in the embryo and its reactivation in the adult may be regarded as a physiological attempt to control inflammatory responses and to 'heal' damaged tissue. However, in pathological contexts such as in tumours or during the development of organ fibrosis, this healing response adopts a sinister nature, steering these diseases towards metastasis and organ failure. Importantly, the chronic inflammatory microenvironment common to fibrotic and cancer cells emerges as a decisive factor in the induction of the pathological EMT.},

  abstract = {The human genome can be segmented into topologically associating domains (TADs), which have been proposed to spatially sequester genes and regulatory elements through chromatin looping. Interactions between TADs have also been suggested, presumably because of variable boundary positions across individual cells. However, the nature, extent and consequence of these dynamic boundaries remain unclear. Here, we combine high-resolution imaging with Oligopaint technology to quantify the interaction frequencies across both weak and strong boundaries. We find that chromatin intermingling across population-defined boundaries is widespread but that the extent of permissibility is locus-specific. Cohesin depletion, which abolishes domain formation at the population level, does not induce ectopic interactions but instead reduces interactions across all boundaries tested. In contrast, WAPL or CTCF depletion increases inter-domain contacts in a cohesin-dependent manner. Reduced chromatin intermingling due to cohesin loss affects the topology and transcriptional bursting frequencies of genes near boundaries. We propose that cohesin occasionally bypasses boundaries to promote incorporation of boundary-proximal genes into neighboring domains.},

  abstract = {Synthetic biology circuits are often constructed with multiple gene expression units assembled in close proximity, and they can be used to perform complex functions in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, mutual interference between transcriptional units has not been well studied in mouse ESCs. To assess the efficiency of insulators at suppressing promoter interference in mouse ESCs, we used an evaluation scheme in which a tunable tetracycline response element promoter is connected to a constant Nanog promoter. The chicken hypersensitive site 4 (cHS4) insulator, widely used both for enhancer blocking and for barrier insulation in~vitro and in~vivo, was positioned between the two expression units for assessment. By inserting the cassette into various loci of the mouse ESC genome with PiggyBac transposon, we were able to quantitatively examine the protective effect of cHS4 by gradually increasing the transcriptional activity of the tetracycline response element promoter with doxycycline and then measuring the transcriptional activity of the Nanog promoter. Our results indicate that the cHS4 insulator has minimal insulating effects on promoter interference in mouse ESCs. Further studies show that the cHS4 insulation effect may be promoter specific and related to interaction with CCCTC-binding factor-mediated loop formation. In addition, we also compared DNA transposition and transgene expression with or without the cHS4 insulator using well-established ESC reporters. The results indicate that cHS4 has no apparent effects on DNA transposition and transgene expression levels, but exerts modest protective effects on long-term transgene silencing., Here we investigated the effect of the chicken hypersensitive site 4 (cHS4) insulator on PiggyBac transposon-based vectors for gene transfer in mouse embryonic stem cells. The presence of the cHS4 insulator between two transcription units did not make any significant difference on suppression of promoter interference and transposition efficiency. Positioning of the cHS4 insulator at both ends of expressing units provided only a modest effect on preventing transgene silencing.},

Little is known about how these variations (noise) in natural systems affect such transitions. In Bacillus subtilis, noise in ComK, the protein that regulates competence for DNA uptake, is thought to cause cells to transition to the competent state in which genes encoding DNA uptake proteins are expressed. We demonstrate that noise in comK expression selects cells for competence and that experimental reduction of this noise decreases the number of competent cells. We also show that transitions are limited temporally by a reduction in comK transcription. These results illustrate how such stochastic transitions are regulated in a natural system and suggest that noise characteristics are subject to evolutionary forces.},

Yet it is unknown how frequently such contacts occur, how long they last and how they depend on the dynamics of chromosome folding and loop extrusion activity of cohesin. By imaging chromosomal locations at high spatial and temporal resolution in living cells, we show that interactions within topologically associating domains are transient and occur frequently during the course of a cell cycle. Interactions become more frequent and longer in the presence of convergent CTCF sites, resulting in suppression of variability in chromosome folding across time. Supported by physical models of chromosome dynamics, our data suggest that CTCF-anchored loops last around 10\,min. Our results show that long-range transcriptional regulation might rely on transient physical proximity, and that cohesin and CTCF stabilize highly dynamic chromosome structures, facilitating selected subsets of chromosomal interactions.},

Given this situation, elements known as chromatin boundaries have evolved to prevent adventitious interactions between enhancers and promoters. The amenability of Drosophila to molecular genetics has been crucial to the discovery and analysis of these elements. Since these elements are involved in such diverse processes and show little or no sequence similarity between them, no single molecular mechanism has been identified that accounts for their activity. However, over the past {$\sim$}5 years, evidence has accumulated suggesting that boundaries probably function through the formation of long-distance chromatin loops. These loops have been proposed to play a crucial role in both controlling enhancer\textendash promoter interactions and packing DNA.},

The role of intergenic RNA is also being investigated with renewed interest. Although a wealth of information on the structure/function relationship of the LCR and globin promoters has been gathered over more than two decades, the fundamental nature of the control of these genes at the molecular level is still not completely understood.

The cell cycle is driven by precise regulation of proteins in time and space, which creates variability between individual proliferating cells. To our knowledge, no systematic investigations of such cell-to-cell proteomic variability exist. Here we present a comprehensive, spatiotemporal map of human proteomic heterogeneity by integrating proteomics at subcellular resolution with single-cell transcriptomics and precise temporal measurements of individual cells in the cell cycle. We show that around one-fifth of the human proteome displays cell-to-cell variability, identify hundreds of proteins with previously unknown associations with mitosis and the cell cycle, and provide evidence that several of these proteins have oncogenic functions. Our results show that cell cycle progression explains less than half of all cell-to-cell variability, and that most cycling proteins are regulated post-translationally, rather than by transcriptomic cycling. These proteins are disproportionately phosphorylated by kinases that regulate cell fate, whereas non-cycling proteins that vary between cells are more likely to be modified by kinases that regulate metabolism. This spatially resolved proteomic map of the cell cycle is integrated into the Human Protein Atlas and will serve as a resource for accelerating molecular studies of the human cell cycle and cell proliferation.},

Previous studies showed that the activity of the Drosophila suHw insulator is abolished by the tandem arrangement (pairing) of the insulator elements, suggesting that interactions between insulators or like elements may be involved in their enhancer-blocking mechanism. To test whether such phenomenon reflects a general property of chromatin insulators, we tested the effect of pairing on enhancer-blocking activity of 11 homologous and heterologous insulator combinations using suHw, scs, or SF1 insulators. We found that, unlike the homologous pairing of suHw, the heterologous combinations of suHw with other insulators do not reduce their enhancer-blocking activity. Rather, paired insulators exhibit a higher level of enhancer-blocking activity than either single insulator alone, suggesting that they can function independently or additively. Furthermore, the analyses of two additional chromatin boundaries, scs and SF1, in homologous or heterologous pairing with other boundary elements, also showed no reduction but rather enhancement of insulator activity. We propose that diverse mechanisms may underlie insulator activity, and selective interactions among insulators could influence their function as well as the formations of independent chromatin domains.},

There is an expanding choice of tightly regulated prokaryotic promoters suitable for achieving high-level gene expression. New host strains facilitate the formation of disulfide bonds in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm and offer higher protein yields by minimizing proteolytic degradation. Insights into the process of protein translocation across the bacterial membranes may eventually make it possible to achieve robust secretion of specific proteins into the culture medium. Studies involving molecular chaperones have shown that in specific cases, chaperones can be very effective for improved protein folding, solubility, and membrane transport. Negative results derived from such studies are also instructive in formulating different strategies. The remarkable increase in the availability of fusion partners offers a wide range of tools for improved protein folding, solubility, protection from proteases, yield, and secretion into the culture medium, as well as for detection and purification of recombinant proteins. Codon usage is known to present a potential impediment to high-level gene expression in E. coli. Although we still do not understand all the rules governing this phenomenon, it is apparent that "rare" codons, depending on their frequency and context, can have an adverse effect on protein levels. Usually, this problem can be alleviated by modification of the relevant codons or by coexpression of the cognate tRNA genes. Finally, the elucidation of specific determinants of protein degradation, a plethora of protease-deficient host strains, and methods to stabilize proteins afford new strategies to minimize proteolytic susceptibility of recombinant proteins in E. coli.},

It is unknown, for example, which may be more predictive of future progression of a neoplasm: genetic homogenization of the neoplasm, possibly caused by a clonal expansion, or the accumulation of clonal diversity. Here, in a prospective study, we show that clonal diversity measures adapted from ecology and evolution can predict progression to adenocarcinoma in the premalignant condition known as Barrett's esophagus, even when controlling for established genetic risk factors, including lesions in TP53 (p53; ref. 6) and ploidy abnormalities7.

However, an evolutionarily neutral lesion may also reach fixation if it spreads as a hitchhiker on a selective sweep. We sought to distinguish advantageous lesions from hitchhikers in the premalignant condition Barrett's esophagus. Patients (211) had biopsies taken at 2-cm intervals in their Barrett's segments. Purified epithelial cells were assayed for loss of heterozygosity and microsatellite shifts on chromosomes 9 and 17, sequence mutations in CDKN2A/MTS1/INK4a (p16) and TP53 (p53), and methylation of the p16 promoter. We measured the expanse of a lesion in a Barrett's segment as the proportion of proliferating cells that carried a lesion in that locus. We then selected the lesion having expanses {$>$}90\% in the greatest number of patients as our first putative advantageous lesion. We filtered out hitchhikers by removing all expanses of other lesions that did not occur independent of the advantageous lesion. The entire process was repeated on the remaining expanses to identify additional advantageous lesions. p16 loss of heterozygosity, promoter methylation, and sequence mutations have strong, independent, advantageous effects on Barrett's cells early in progression. Second lesions in p16 and p53 are associated with later selective sweeps. Virtually all of the other lesion expansions, including microsatellite shifts, could be explained as hitchhikers on p16 lesion clonal expansions. These techniques can be applied to any neoplasm.},

How these subnuclear domains are established and maintained is not well understood. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanism of how one nuclear body, the paraspeckle, is assembled and organized. Paraspeckles are discrete ribonucleoprotein bodies found in mammalian cells and implicated in nuclear retention of hyperedited mRNAs. We developed a live-cell imaging system that allows for the inducible transcription of Men {$\epsilon$}/{$\beta$} (also known as Neat1; ref. 12) noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and the direct visualization of the recruitment of paraspeckle proteins. Using this system, we demonstrate that Men {$\epsilon$}/{$\beta$} ncRNAs are essential to initiate the de novo assembly of paraspeckles. These newly formed structures effectively harbour nuclear-retained mRNAs confirming that they are bona fide functional paraspeckles. By three independent approaches, we show that it is the act of Men {$\epsilon$}/{$\beta$} transcription, but not ncRNAs alone, that regulates paraspeckle maintenance. Finally, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analyses supported a critical structural role for Men {$\epsilon$}/{$\beta$} ncRNAs in paraspeckle organization. This study establishes a model in which Men {$\epsilon$}/{$\beta$} ncRNAs serve as a platform to recruit proteins to assemble paraspeckles.},

Most of these sequences have not been functionally tested, and our limited understanding of the non-coding genome prevents us from predicting which sequences are bona fide cis-regulatory elements. Recently, massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) have been deployed to measure the activity of putative cis-regulatory sequences in several biological contexts, each with specific advantages and distinct limitations. We developed LV-MPRA, a novel lentiviral-based, massively parallel reporter gene assay, to study the function of genome-integrated regulatory elements in any mammalian cell type; thus, making it possible to apply MPRAs in more biologically relevant contexts. We measured the activity of 2,600 sequences in U87 glioblastoma cells and human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) and explored how regulatory activity is encoded in DNA sequence. We demonstrate that LV-MPRA can be applied to estimate the effects of local DNA sequence and regional chromatin on regulatory activity. Our data reveal that primary DNA sequence features, such as GC content and dinucleotide composition, accurately distinguish sequences with high activity from sequences with low activity in a full chromosomal context, and may also function in combination with different transcription factor binding sites to determine cell type specificity. We conclude that LV-MPRA will be an important tool for identifying cis-regulatory elements and stimulating new understanding about how the non-coding genome encodes information.},

We used high-throughput combinatorial reporter assays to test thousands of CRE-promoter pairs from three Mb-sized genomic regions in mouse cells. This revealed that CREs vary substantially in their promoter compatibility, ranging from striking specificity to broad promiscuity. More than half of the tested CREs exhibit significant promoter selectivity. Housekeeping promoters tend to have similar CRE preferences, but other promoters exhibit a wide diversity of compatibilities. Higher-order transcription factors (TF) motif combinations may account for compatibility.

  abstract = {The establishment of cell types during development requires precise interactions between genes and distal regulatory sequences. We have a limited understanding of how these interactions look in three dimensions, vary across cell types in complex tissue, and relate to transcription. Here we describe optical reconstruction of chromatin architecture (ORCA), a method that can trace the DNA path in single cells with nanoscale accuracy and genomic resolution reaching two kilobases. We used ORCA to study a Hox gene cluster in cryosectioned Drosophila embryos and labelled around 30 RNA species in parallel. We identified cell-type-specific physical borders between active and Polycomb-repressed DNA, and unexpected Polycomb-independent borders. Deletion of Polycomb-independent borders led to ectopic enhancer\textendash promoter contacts, aberrant gene expression, and developmental defects. Together, these results illustrate an approach for high-resolution, single-cell DNA domain analysis in vivo, identify domain structures that change with cell identity, and show that border elements contribute to the formation of physical domains in Drosophila.},

  abstract = {Early reports suggested androgen/androgen receptor (AR) signals promote hepatocarcinogenesis. However, all antiandrogen clinical trials failed in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) without reasonable explanations. We examined AR functions in HCC cancer metastasis in this study. We examined hepatic AR roles in HCC metastasis by comparing liver hepatocyte AR knockout and wildtype in a carcinogen-induced HCC mouse model. We examined tumor histology, cancer metastatic risks, and cancer survival in vivo, as well as cell anoikis and migration using primary hepatic tumor culture in vitro. We also examined therapeutic potentials of AR expression combined with the molecular targeting agent sorafenib in an HCC metastasis mouse model. We found a novel cancer phenotype in which mice lacking hepatic AR developed more undifferentiated tumors and larger tumor size at the metastatic stage. These mice also died earlier with increased lung metastasis, suggesting that hepatic AR may play dual yet opposite roles to promote HCC initiation but suppress HCC metastasis. Mechanistic dissection found that hepatic AR could enhance anoikis and suppress migration of HCC cells by way of suppression of p38 phosphorylation/activation and the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-{$\kappa$}B)/matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) pathway, respectively. In addition, the in vivo preclinical trials concluded that a combination therapy of increased AR expression and reduced multiple-kinase inhibitor (sorafenib) exhibited better therapeutic efficacy. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that AR could orchestrate intrahepatic signaling hierarchies and cellular behaviors, consequently affect HCC progression. Results from combination therapy shed light on developing new therapeutic paradigms for battling HCC at later metastatic stages. (HEPATOLOGY 2012;56:176\textendash 185)},

Synthetic mammalian quorum-sensing circuits could provide insight into principles of population control and extend cell therapies. However, a key challenge is reducing their inherent sensitivity to "cheater" mutations that evade control. Here, we repurposed the plant hormone auxin to enable orthogonal mammalian cell-cell communication and quorum sensing. We designed a paradoxical population control circuit, termed "Paradaux," in which auxin stimulates and inhibits net cell growth at different concentrations. This circuit limited population size over extended timescales of up to 42~days of continuous culture. By contrast, when operating in a non-paradoxical regime, population control became more susceptible to mutational escape. These results establish auxin as a versatile "private" communication system and demonstrate that paradoxical circuit architectures can provide robust population control.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The epsilon4 allele of the gene encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE) is strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease, but its value in the diagnosis remains uncertain. METHODS: We reviewed clinical diagnoses and diagnoses obtained at autopsy in 2188 patients referred to 1 of 26 Alzheimer's disease centers for evaluation of dementia. The sensitivity and specificity of the clinical diagnosis or the presence of an APOE epsilon4 allele were calculated, with pathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease used as the standard. The added value of the APOE genotype was estimated with pretest and post-test probabilities from multivariate analyses to generate receiver-operating-characteristic curves plotting sensitivity against the false positive rate. RESULTS: Of the 2188 patients, 1833 were given a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and the diagnosis was confirmed pathologically in 1770 patients at autopsy. Sixty-two percent of patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease, as compared with 65 percent of those with pathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease, had at least one APOE epsilon4 allele. The sensitivity of the clinical diagnosis was 93 percent, and the specificity was 55 percent, whereas the sensitivity and specificity of the APOE epsilon4 allele were 65 and 68 percent, respectively. The addition of information about the APOE genotype increased the overall specificity to 84 percent in patients who met the clinical criteria for Alzheimer's disease, although the sensitivity decreased. The improvement in specificity remained statistically significant in the multivariate analysis after adjustment for differences in age, clinical diagnosis, sex, and center. CONCLUSIONS: APOE genotyping does not provide sufficient sensitivity or specificity to be used alone as a diagnostic test for Alzheimer's disease, but when used in combination with clinical criteria, it improves the specificity of the diagnosis.},

During late G1 and throughout S-phase, p27 phosphorylation at T187 leads to its subsequent degradation, which relieves CDK2 inhibition to promote cell cycle progression. However, critical events that trigger CDK2 complexes to phosphorylate p27 remain unclear. Utilizing recombinant proteins, we demonstrate that human Speedy (Spy1) activates CDK2 to phosphorylate p27 at T187 in vitro. Addition of Spy1 or Spy1/CDK2 to a preformed, inhibited cyclin E/CDK2/p27 complex also promoted this phosphorylation. Furthermore, Spy1 protected cyclin E/CDK2 from p27 inhibition toward histone H1, in vitro. Inducible Spy1 expression in U2OS cells reduced levels of endogenous p27 and exogenous p27WT, but not a p27T187A mutant. Additionally, Spy1 expression in synchronized HeLa cells enhanced T187 phosphorylation and degradation of endogenous p27 in late G1 and throughout S-phase. Our studies provide evidence that Spy1 expression enhances CDK2-dependent p27 degradation during late G1 and throughout S-phase.},

The basis for locus specificity is unclear. Previously, we identified 172 proteins that are embedded in sonication-resistant heterochromatin (srHC) harbouring H3K9me3. Here, we investigate in humans how 97 of the H3K9me3-srHC proteins repress heterochromatic genes. We reveal four groups of srHC proteins that each repress many common genes and repeat elements. Two groups repress H3K9me3-embedded genes with different extents of flanking srHC, one group is specific for srHC genes with H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, and one group is specific for genes with srHC as the primary feature. We find that the enhancer of rudimentary homologue (ERH) is conserved from Schizosaccharomyces pombe in repressing meiotic genes and, in humans, now represses other lineage-specific genes and repeat elements. The study greatly expands our understanding of H3K9me3-based gene repression in vertebrates.},

  abstract = {Cancer progression is an example of a rapid adaptive process where evolving new traits is essential for survival and requires a high mutation rate. Precancerous cells acquire a few key mutations that drive rapid population growth and carcinogenesis. Cancer genomics demonstrates that these few driver mutations occur alongside thousands of random passenger mutations\textemdash a natural consequence of cancer's elevated mutation rate. Some passengers are deleterious to cancer cells, yet have been largely ignored in cancer research. In population genetics, however, the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations has been shown to cause population meltdown. Here we develop a stochastic population model where beneficial drivers engage in a tug-of-war with frequent mildly deleterious passengers. These passengers present a barrier to cancer progression describable by a critical population size, below which most lesions fail to progress, and a critical mutation rate, above which cancers melt down. We find support for this model in cancer age\textendash incidence and cancer genomics data that also allow us to estimate the fitness advantage of drivers and fitness costs of passengers. We identify two regimes of adaptive evolutionary dynamics and use these regimes to understand successes and failures of different treatment strategies. A tumor's load of deleterious passengers can explain previously paradoxical treatment outcomes and suggest that it could potentially serve as a biomarker of response to mutagenic therapies. The collective deleterious effect of passengers is currently an unexploited therapeutic target. We discuss how their effects might be exacerbated by current and future therapies.},

Errors intrinsic to this method are discussed. The changes in the tubule distributions from one mitotic stage to another provide evidence concerning the behavior of the spindle tubules during mitosis. The ratio of the number of tubules passing the chromosomes on the metaphase plate to the maximum number in each half spindle is about 1/2. This ratio changes little in early anaphase, and then decreases in late anaphase at about the same time that a zone of increased tubule number develops at the middle of the interzone. The region where the stem bodies form contains about 3/2 the number of tubules seen elsewhere in the interzone. This ratio is almost constant as the mid-body forms in telophase and then increases to 2/1 in early interphase before the final stages of cytokinesis occur.},

Typically, the biologist specifies a set of genes believed to be co-regulated and a library of known DNA-binding models for transcription factors, and MEA determines which (if any) of the factors may be direct regulators of the genes. Since the number of factors with known DNA-binding models is rapidly increasing as a result of high-throughput technologies, MEA is becoming increasingly useful.

  abstract = {The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1) is central to a number of pathological processes through the induction of specific genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Even though HIF-1 is highly regulated by cellular oxygen levels, other elements of the inflammatory and tumor microenvironment were shown to influence its activity under normal oxygen concentration. Among others, recent studies indicated that transforming growth factor (TGF) beta increases the expression of the regulatory HIF-1alpha subunit, and induces HIF-1 DNA binding activity. Here, we demonstrate that TGFbeta acts on HIF-1alpha accumulation and activity by increasing HIF-1alpha protein stability. In particular, we demonstrate that TGFbeta markedly and specifically decreases both mRNA and protein levels of a HIF-1alpha-associated prolyl hydroxylase (PHD), PHD2, through the Smad signaling pathway. As a consequence, the degradation of HIF-1alpha was inhibited as determined by impaired degradation of a reporter protein containing the HIF-1alpha oxygen-dependent degradation domain encompassing the PHD-targeted prolines. Moreover, inhibition of the TGFbeta1 converting enzyme, furin, resulted in increased PHD2 expression, and decreased basal HIF-1alpha and VEGF levels, suggesting that endogenous production of bioactive TGFbeta1 efficiently regulates HIF-1-targeted genes. This was reinforced by results from HIF-1alpha knock-out or HIF-1alpha-inhibited cells that show impairment in VEGF production in response to TGFbeta. This study reveals a novel mechanism by which a growth factor controls HIF-1 stability, and thereby drives the expression of specific genes, through the regulation of PHD2 levels.},

We used RNA interference to investigate the contribution of the MRTF\textendash SRF pathway to cytoskeletal dynamics in MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma and B16F2 melanoma cells, in which basal MRTF\textendash SRF activity is Rho-dependent. Depletion of MRTFs or SRF reduced cell adhesion, spreading, invasion and motility in culture, without affecting proliferation or inducing apoptosis. MRTF-depleted tumour cell xenografts showed reduced cell motility but proliferated normally. Tumour cells depleted of MRTF or SRF failed to colonize the lung from the bloodstream, being unable to persist after their arrival in the lung. Only a few genes show MRTF-dependent expression in both cell lines. Two of these, MYH9 (NMHCIIa) and MYL9 (MLC2), are also required for invasion and lung colonization. Conversely, expression of activated MAL/MRTF-A increases lung colonization by poorly metastatic B16F0 cells. Actin-based cell behaviour and experimental metastasis thus require Rho-dependent nuclear signalling through the MRTF\textendash SRF network.},

Mice lacking both MyoD and dystrophin displayed a marked increase in severity of myopathy leading to premature death, suggesting a role for MyoD in muscle regeneration. Examination of MyoD mutant muscle revealed elevated numbers of myogenic cells; however, myoblasts derived from these cells displayed normal differentiation potential in vitro. Following injury, MyoD mutant muscle was severely deficient in regenerative ability, and we observed a striking reduction in the in vivo proliferation of myogenic cells during regeneration. Therefore, we propose that the failure of MyoD-deficient muscle to regenerate efficiently is not caused by a reduction in numbers of satellite cells, the stem cells of adult skeletal muscle, but results from an increased propensity for stem-cell self-renewal rather than progression through the myogenic program.},

These elements can block the communication between an enhancer and a gene when placed between them. Interestingly, it has been previously observed that two tandem copies of the Drosophila Su(Hw) insulator abolish this enhancer-blocking activity, presumably through pairing. This bypass effect has not been described with other insulators, however. In this report, we show that the insertion of binding sites for the GAGA factor (GAF) between an enhancer and the Su(Hw) insulator allows bypassing of the insulator. This bypass relies on the activity of both the GAF protein and the Mod(mdg4)-67.2 protein, a factor required for Su(Hw) insulator activity. We show that these two proteins interact in vitro and in vivo, providing molecular evidence of pairing between the GAF sites and the Su(Hw) insulator. Finally, we show that placing the Mcp boundary together with the Su(Hw) insulator between an enhancer and a promoter leads to bypass, again in a GAF- and Mod(mdg4)-dependent manner. Our data provide direct evidence that heterologous insulators can be bypassed by distal enhancers and identify the interaction between GAF and Mod(mdg4) as a possible means to regulate insulator activity.},

Survivin has been found to be abundantly expressed in a wide variety of human malignancies, whereas it is undetectable in normal adult tissues. We aimed to study the expression of three survivin splicing variants in gastric cancer, and to evaluate the prognostic significance of the expression of survivin variants in gastric cancer. METHODS: Real time quantitative RT-PCR was performed to analyze the expression of survivin variants in 79 paired tumors and normal gastric mucosa samples at the mRNA level. Proliferative and apoptotic activity was measured using Ki-67 immunohistochemical analysis and the TUNEL method, respectively. RESULTS: All the cases tested expressed wild-type survivin mRNA, which was not only the dominant transcript, but also a poor prognostic biomarker (P = 0.003). Non-antiapoptostic survivin-2B mRNA was correlated with tumor stage (P = 0.001), histological type (P = 0.004), and depth of tumor invasion (P = 0.041), while survivin-DeltaEx3 mRNA showed a significant association with apoptosis (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Wild-type survivin mRNA expression levels are of important prognostic value and significant participation of survivin-2B and survivin-DeltaEx3 is suggested in gastric cancer development.},

Emergence of the roots is dependent on flooding of the plant and is mediated by ethylene action. Root growth was preceded by the induced death of epidermal cells of the node external to the tip of the root primordium. Cell death proceeded until the epidermis split open. Through this crack the root eventually emerged. Induced death was confined to nodal epidermal cells covering the tip of the primordia. Our results suggest that this process facilitates adventitious root emergence and prevents injury to the growing root. Cell death was inducible not only by submergence but also by application of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, the natural precursor of ethylene and it was suppressed in the presence of 2,5-norbornadiene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene), an inhibitor of ethylene action. Adventitious root growth and epidermal cell death are therefore linked to the ethylene signaling pathway, which is activated in response to low oxygen stress.},

Several dpp enhancers are positioned close to Slh and oaf, and yet these genes are unaffected by the dpp elements. However, when a transposon is located within the oaf gene, the dpp enhancers activate the more distant transposon promoters while still ignoring the closer Slh and oaf start sites. To test whether this promoter specificity accounts for the regulatory autonomy normally found for the three genes, we used in vivo gene targeting to replace the oaf promoter with a dpp-compatible one in an otherwise normal chromosome. Strikingly, this chimeric gene is now activated by the dpp enhancers. Thus, the properties of the promoters themselves are sufficient to mediate the autonomous regulation of genes in this region.},

We hypothesized that clonal diversity is associated with risk of progression to cancer. We obtained molecular data from a cohort of 239 participants with Barrett's esophagus, including microsatellite shifts and loss of heterozygosity, DNA content tetraploidy and aneuploidy, methylation, and sequence mutations. Using these data, we tested all major diversity measurement methods, including genetic divergence and entropy-based measures, to determine which measures are correlated with risk of progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma. We also tested whether the use of different sets of loci and alterations to define clones (e.g., selectively advantageous versus evolutionarily neutral) improved the predictive value of the diversity indices. All diversity measures were strong and highly significant predictors of progression (Cox proportional hazards model, P {$<$} 0.001). The type of alterations evaluated had little effect on the predictive value of most of the diversity measures. In summary, diversity measures are robust predictors of progression to cancer in this cohort. Cancer Prev Res; 3(11); 1388\textendash 97. \textcopyright 2010 AACR.},

  abstract = {Exposure of cells to stressful conditions results in the rapid synthesis of a subset of specialized proteins termed heat shock proteins (HSPs) which function in protecting the cell against damage. The stress-induced activation of hsp genes is controlled by the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1). At the cellular level, one of the most striking effects of stress is the rapid and reversible redistribution of HSF1 into a few nuclear structures termed nuclear stress granules which form primarily on the 9q12 locus in humans. Within these structures, HSF1 binds to satellite III repeated elements and drives the RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription of these sequences into stable RNAs which remain associated with the 9q12 locus for a certain time after synthesis. Other proteins, in particular splicing factors, were also shown to relocalize to the granules upon stress. Here, we investigated the role of stress-induced satellite III transcripts in the relocalization of splicing factors to the granules. We show that the recruitment of the two serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins SF2/ASF and SRp30c requires the presence of stress-induced satellite III transcripts. In agreement with these findings, we identified the second RNA-recognition motif (RRM2) of hSF2/ASF as the motif required for the targeting to the granules, and we showed by immunoprecipitation that the endogenous hSF2/ASF protein is present in a complex with satellite III transcripts in stressed cells in vivo. Interestingly, satellite III transcripts also immunoprecipitate together with small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) in vivo whereas the intronless hsp70 transcripts do not, supporting the proposal that these transcripts are subject to splicing. Altogether, these data highlight the central role for satellite III transcripts in the targeting and/or retention of splicing factors into the granules upon stress.},

During the early phase of tumour progression, TGF-{$\beta$} acts as a tumour suppressor, exemplified by deletions or mutations in the core components of the TGF-{$\beta$} signalling pathway. On the contrary, TGF-{$\beta$} also promotes processes that support tumour progression such as tumour cell invasion, dissemination, and immune evasion. Consequently, the functional outcome of the TGF-{$\beta$} response is strongly context-dependent including cell, tissue, and cancer type. In this review, we describe the molecular signalling pathways employed by TGF-{$\beta$} in cancer and how these, when perturbed, may lead to the development of cancer. Concomitantly with our increased appreciation of the molecular mechanisms that govern TGF-{$\beta$} signalling, the potential to therapeutically target specific oncogenic sub-arms of the TGF-{$\beta$} pathway increases. Indeed, clinical trials with systemic TGF-{$\beta$} signalling inhibitors for treatment of cancer patients have been initiated. However, considering the important role of TGF-{$\beta$} in cardiovascular and many other tissues, careful screening of patients is warranted to minimize unwanted on-target side effects.},

In contrast, widely employed experimental and therapeutic approaches such as knock-in/out strategies are more suitable for binary control of gene activity. Here we report on a method for precise control of gene expression levels in mammalian cells using engineered microRNA response elements (MREs). First, we measure the efficacy of thousands of synthetic MRE variants under the control of an endogenous microRNA by high-throughput sequencing. Guided by this data, we establish a library of microRNA silencing-mediated fine-tuners (miSFITs) of varying strength that can be employed to precisely control the expression of user-specified genes. We apply this technology to tune the T-cell co-inhibitory receptor PD-1 and to explore how antigen expression influences T-cell activation and tumour growth. Finally, we employ CRISPR/Cas9 mediated homology directed repair to introduce miSFITs into the BRCA1 3{${'}$}UTR, demonstrating that this versatile tool can be used to tune endogenous genes.},

The cellular specificity of reporter expression from enhancer-AAVs is established by molecular profiling after systemic AAV delivery in mouse. Over 30\% of enhancer-AAVs produce specific expression in the targeted subclass, including both excitatory and inhibitory subclasses. We present a collection of Parvalbumin (PVALB) enhancer-AAVs that show highly enriched expression not only in cortical PVALB cells but also in some subcortical PVALB populations. Five vectors maintain PVALB-enriched expression in primate neocortex. These results demonstrate how genome-wide open chromatin data mining and cross-species AAV validation can be used to create the next generation of non-species-restricted viral genetic tools.},

In HeLa cells, both CLASPs concentrate on the distal MT ends in a narrow region at the cell margin. CLASPs stabilize MTs by promoting pauses and restricting MT growth and shortening episodes to this peripheral cell region. We demonstrate that the middle part of CLASPs binds directly to EB1 and to MTs. Furthermore, we show that the association of CLASP2 with the cell cortex is MT independent and relies on its COOH-terminal domain. Both EB1- and cortex-binding domains of CLASP are required to promote MT stability. We propose that CLASPs can mediate interactions between MT plus ends and the cell cortex and act as local rescue factors, possibly through forming a complex with EB1 at MT tips.},

The relative order in which these mutations accumulate and contribute to cell fitness is affected by epistatic interactions. Inferring their evolutionary history is challenging because of the large number of mutations acquired by cancer cells as well as the presence of unknown epistatic interactions. Results: We developed Bayesian Mutation Landscape (BML), a probabilistic approach for reconstructing ancestral genotypes from tumor samples for much larger sets of genes than previously feasible. BML infers the likely sequence of mutation accumulation for any set of genes that is recurrently mutated in tumor samples. When applied to tumor samples from colorectal, glioblastoma, lung and ovarian cancer patients, BML identifies the diverse evolutionary scenarios involved in tumor initiation and progression in greater detail, but broadly in agreement with prior results.

Their pivotal role in mitosis makes them a target for the development of anticancer drugs. Microtubule-damaging agents suppress microtubule dynamics, leading to disruption of the mitotic spindle in dividing cells, cell cycle arrest at M phase, and late apoptosis. A better understanding of the processes coupling microtubule damage to the onset of apoptosis will reveal sites of potential intervention in cancer chemotherapy. Inhibition of microtubule dynamics induces persistent modification of biological processes (M arrest) and signaling pathways (mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint activation, Bcl-2 phosphorylation, c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase activation), which ultimately lead to apoptosis through the accumulation of signals that finally reach the threshold for the onset of apoptosis or through diminishing the threshold for engagement of cell death. Microtubules serve also as scaffolds for signaling molecules that regulate apoptosis, such as Bim and survivin, and their release from microtubules affect the activities of these apoptosis regulators. Thus, sustained modification of signaling routes and changes in the scaffolding properties of microtubules seem to constitute two major processes in the apoptotic response induced by microtubule-interfering agents.},

  abstract = {Human preimplantation embryonic cells are similar in phenotype to cancer cells. Both types of cell undergo deprogramming to a proliferative stem cell state and become potentially immortal and invasive. To investigate the hypothesis that embryonic genes are re-expressed in cancer cells, we prepare amplified cDNA from human individual preimplantation embryos and isolate embryo-specific sequences. We show that three novel embryonic genes, and also the known gene, OCT4, are expressed in human tumours but not expressed in normal somatic tissues. Genes specific to this unique phase of the human life cycle and not expressed in somatic cells may have greater potential for targeting in cancer treatment.},

  abstract = {The cellular abundance of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p27 is regulated by the ubiquitin\textendash proteasome system. Activation of p27 degradation is seen in proliferating cells and in many types of aggressive human carcinomas. p27 can be phosphorylated on threonine 187 by Cdks, and cyclin E/Cdk2 overexpression can stimulate the degradation of wild-type p27, but not of a threonine 187-to-alanine p27 mutant [p27(T187A)]. However, whether threonine 187 phosphorylation stimulates p27 degradation through the ubiquitin\textendash proteasome system or an alternative pathway is still not known. Here, we demonstrate that p27 ubiquitination (as assayed in vivo and in an in vitro reconstituted system) is cell-cycle regulated and that Cdk activity is required for the in vitro ubiquitination of p27. Furthermore, ubiquitination of wild-type p27, but not of p27(T187A), can occur in G1-enriched extracts only upon addition of cyclin E/Cdk2 or cyclin A/Cdk2. Using a phosphothreonine 187 site-specific antibody for p27, we show that threonine 187 phosphorylation of p27 is also cell-cycle dependent, being present in proliferating cells but undetectable in G1cells. Finally, we show that in addition to threonine 187 phosphorylation, efficient p27 ubiquitination requires formation of a trimeric complex with the cyclin and Cdk subunits. In fact, cyclin B/Cdk1 which can phosphorylate p27 efficiently, but cannot form a stable complex with it, is unable to stimulate p27 ubiquitination by G1 extracts. Furthermore, another p27 mutant [p27(CK-)] that can be phosphorylated by cyclin E/Cdk2 but cannot bind this kinase complex, is refractory to ubiquitination. Thus throughout the cell cycle, both phosphorylation and trimeric complex formation act as signals for the ubiquitination of a Cdk inhibitor.},

  abstract = {Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process occurring during embryonic development and in fibrosis and tumor progression. Dissociation of cell-cell contacts and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton are major events of the EMT. Here, we show that myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs; also known as MAL and MKL) are critical mediators of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) 1-induced EMT. In all epithelial cell lines examined here, TGF-beta1 triggers the nuclear translocation of MRTFs. Ectopic expression of constitutive-active MRTF-A induces EMT, whereas dominant-negative MRTF-A or knockdown of MRTF-A and -B prevents the TGF-beta1-induced EMT. MRTFs form complexes with Smad3. Via Smad3, the MRTF-Smad3 complexes bind to a newly identified cis-element GCCG-like motif in the promoter region of Canis familiaris and the human slug gene, which activates slug transcription and thereby dissociation of cell-cell contacts. MRTFs also increase the expression levels of actin cytoskeletal proteins via serum response factor, thereby triggering reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Thus, MRTFs are important mediators of TGF-beta1-induced EMT.},

The interaction of coilin with other proteins appears to increase the efficiency of several nuclear processes by concentrating their components in the Cajal body. The best-known of these processes is the modification and assembly of U snRNPs, some of which eventually form the RNA splicing machinery, or spliceosome. Over the last 10~years, research into the function of Cajal bodies has been greatly stimulated by the discovery that SMN, the protein deficient in the inherited neuromuscular disease, spinal muscular atrophy, is a Cajal body component and has an essential role in the assembly of spliceosomal U snRNPs in the cytoplasm and their delivery to the Cajal body in the nucleus.},

SURVIVIN, an inhibitor of apoptosis, is also a chromosomal passenger protein (CPP). Previous results have demonstrated that SURVIVIN is expressed at high levels in embryonic stem cells and inhibition of SURVIVIN function results in apoptosis, however these studies have not investigated the other four splice variants. In this study, we demonstrate that all variants are expressed at significantly higher levels in human embryonic stem (hES) cells than in differentiated cells. We examined the subcellular localization of the three most highly expressed variants. SURVIVIN displayed canonical CPP localization in mitotic cells and cytoplasmic localization in interphase cells. In contrast, SURVIVIN\textendash{$\Delta$}Ex3 and SURVIVIN\textendash 2B did not localize as a CPP; SURVIVIN\textendash{$\Delta$}Ex3 was found constitutively in the nucleus while SURVIVIN\textendash 2B was distributed along the chromosomes during mitosis and also to the mitotic spindle poles. We used inducible shRNA against SURVIVIN to inhibit expression in a titratable fashion. Using this system, we reduced the mRNA levels of these three variants to approx. 40\%, resulting in a concomitant reduction of OCT4 and NANOG mRNA, suggesting a role for the SURVIVIN variants in pluripotency.},

  abstract = {Neuropsychiatric phenotypes have long been known to be influenced by heritable risk factors, directly confirmed by the past decade of genetic studies that have revealed specific genetic variants enriched in disease cohorts. However, the initial hope that a small set of genes would be responsible for a given disorder proved false. The more complex reality is that a given disorder may be influenced by myriad small-effect noncoding variants and/or by rare but severe coding variants, many de novo. Noncoding genomic sequences-for which molecular functions cannot usually be inferred-harbor a large portion of these variants, creating a substantial barrier to understanding higher-order molecular and biological systems of disease. Fortunately, novel genetic technologies-scalable oligonucleotide synthesis, RNA sequencing, and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-have opened novel avenues to experimentally identify biologically significant variants en masse. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) are an especially versatile technique resulting from such innovations. MPRAs are powerful molecular genetics tools that can be used to screen thousands of untranscribed or untranslated sequences and their variants for functional effects in a single experiment. This approach, though underutilized in psychiatric genetics, has several useful features for the field. We review methods for assaying putatively functional genetic variants and regions, emphasizing MPRAs and the opportunities they hold for dissection of psychiatric polygenicity. We discuss literature applying functional assays in neurogenetics, highlighting strengths, caveats, and design considerations-especially regarding disease-relevant variables (cell type, neurodevelopment, and sex), and we ultimately propose applications of MPRA to both computational and experimental neurogenetics of polygenic disease risk.},

The majority of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linkage blocks associated with MDD by genome-wide association studies (GWASes) are believed to alter transcriptional regulators (e.g., enhancers, promoters) based on enrichment of marks correlated with these functions. A key to understanding MDD pathophysiology will be elucidation of which SNPs are functional and how such functional variants biologically converge to elicit the disease. Furthermore, retinoids can elicit MDD in patients and promote depressive-like behaviors in rodent models, acting via a regulatory system of retinoid receptor transcription factors (TFs). We therefore sought to simultaneously identify functional genetic variants and assess retinoid pathway regulation of MDD risk loci. Using Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs), we functionally screened over 1000 SNPs prioritized from 39 neuropsychiatric trait/disease GWAS loci, selecting SNPs based on overlap with predicted regulatory features\textemdash including expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and histone marks\textemdash from human brains and cell cultures. We identified {$>$}100 SNPs with allelic effects on expression in a retinoid-responsive model system. Functional SNPs were enriched for binding sequences of retinoic acid-receptive transcription factors (TFs), with additional allelic differences unmasked by treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Finally, motifs overrepresented across functional SNPs corresponded to TFs highly specific to serotonergic neurons, suggesting an in vivo site of action. Our application of MPRAs to screen MDD-associated SNPs suggests a shared transcriptional-regulatory program across loci, a component of which is unmasked by retinoids.},

  abstract = {Phenotypic variation is ubiquitous in biology and is often traceable to underlying genetic and environmental variation. However, even genetically identical cells in identical environments display variable phenotypes. Stochastic gene expression, or gene expression `noise', has been suggested as a major source of this variability, and its physiological consequences have been topics of intense research for the last decade. Several recent studies have measured variability in protein and mRNA levels, and have discovered strong connections between noise and gene regulation mechanisms. When integrated with discrete stochastic models, measurements of cell-to-cell variability provide a sensitive `fingerprint' with which to explore fundamental questions on gene regulation. In this review, we highlight several studies that used gene expression variability to develop a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms and dynamics of gene regulation.},

FIREWACh simultaneously assessed over 80,000 DNA fragments derived from ``nucleosome-free regions'' within embryonic stem cell (ESC) chromatin to identify 6,364 new active regulatory elements. Many FIREWACh DNAs represent newly discovered ESC-specific enhancers and their analyses identified enriched binding site motifs for ESC transcription factors including SOX2, OCT4 (POU5f1), and KLF4. Thus FIREWACh identifies endogenous regulators of gene expression and can be used for the discovery of key cell-specific transcription factors.

  abstract = {CD28 is one of the most relevant costimulatory receptors that deliver both TCR-dependent and TCR-independent signals regulating a wide range of signaling pathways crucial for cytokine and chemokine gene expressions, T cell survival, and proliferation. Most of the CD28-dependent signaling functions are initiated by the recruitment and activation of class IA PI3Ks, which catalyze the conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) into phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, thus generating the docking sites for key signaling proteins. Hence, PIP2 is a crucial substrate in driving the PI3K downstream signaling pathways, and PIP2 turnover may be an essential regulatory step to ensure the activation of PI3K following CD28 engagement. Despite some data evidence that CD28 augments TCR-induced turnover of PIP2, its direct role in regulating PIP2 metabolism has never been assessed. In this study, we show that CD28 regulates PIP2 turnover by recruiting and activating phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases {$\alpha$} (PIP5K{$\alpha$}) in human primary CD4+ T lymphocytes. This event leads to the neosynthesis of PIP2 and to its consumption by CD28-activated PI3K. We also evidenced that PIP5K{$\alpha$} activation is required for both CD28 unique signals regulating IL-8 gene expression as well as for CD28/TCR-induced Ca2+ mobilization, NF-AT nuclear translocation, and IL-2 gene transcription. Our findings elucidate a novel mechanism that involves PIP5K{$\alpha$} as a key modulator of CD28 costimulatory signals.},

To investigate the physiological role of paraspeckles, we examined the in vivo expression patterns of two long noncoding RNAs, NEAT1\_1 and NEAT1\_2, which are essential for the architectural integrity of nuclear bodies. Unexpectedly, these genes were only strongly expressed in a particular subpopulation of cells in adult mouse tissues, and prominent paraspeckle formation was observed only in the cells highly expressing NEAT1\_2. To further investigate the cellular functions of paraspeckles, we created an animal model lacking NEAT1 by gene targeting. These knockout mice were viable and fertile under laboratory growth conditions, showing no apparent phenotypes except for the disappearance of paraspeckles. We propose that paraspeckles are nonessential, subpopulation-specific nuclear bodies formed secondary to particular environmental triggers.},

To address the physiological function of Malat1 in a living organism, we generated Malat1-knockout (KO) mice using homologous recombination. Unexpectedly, the Malat1-KO mice were viable and fertile, showing no apparent phenotypes. Nuclear speckle markers were also correctly localized in cells that lacked Malat1. However, the cellular levels of another long, noncoding RNA--Neat1--which is an architectural component of nuclear bodies known as paraspeckles, were down-regulated in a particular set of tissues and cells lacking Malat1.

Deletion of CTCF binding sites within the Hox clusters results in the expansion of active chromatin into the repressive domain.

Ablation of CTCF binding disrupts topological boundaries such that caudal Hox genes leave the repressed domain and become subject to transcriptional activation.

However, the global kinetics and mechanisms of p300/CBP activity-dependent transcription activation remain poorly understood. We performed genome-wide, time-resolved analyses to show that enhancers and super-enhancers are dynamically activated through p300/CBP-catalyzed acetylation, deactivated by the opposing deacetylase activity, and kinetic acetylation directly contributes to maintaining cell identity at very rapid (minutes) timescales. The acetyltransferase activity is dispensable for the recruitment of p300/CBP and transcription factors but essential for promoting the recruitment of TFIID and RNAPII at virtually all enhancers and enhancer-regulated genes. This identifies pre-initiation complex assembly as a dynamically controlled step in the transcription cycle and reveals p300/CBP-catalyzed acetylation as the signal that specifically promotes transcription initiation at enhancer-regulated genes. We propose that p300/CBP activity uses a ``recruit-and-release'' mechanism to simultaneously promote RNAPII recruitment and pause release and thereby enables kinetic activation of enhancer-mediated transcription.},

  abstract = {Cohesin is a chromatin-associated protein complex that mediates sister chromatid cohesion by connecting replicated DNA molecules. Cohesin also has important roles in gene regulation, but the mechanistic basis of this function is poorly understood. In mammalian genomes, cohesin co-localizes with CCCTC binding factor (CTCF), a zinc finger protein implicated in multiple gene regulatory events. At the imprinted IGF2-H19 locus, CTCF plays an important role in organizing allele-specific higher-order chromatin conformation and functions as an enhancer blocking transcriptional insulator. Here we have used chromosome conformation capture (3C) assays and RNAi\textendash mediated depletion of cohesin to address whether cohesin affects higher order chromatin conformation at the IGF2-H19 locus in human cells. Our data show that cohesin has a critical role in maintaining CTCF\textendash mediated chromatin conformation at the locus and that disruption of this conformation coincides with changes in IGF2 expression. We show that the cohesin-dependent, higher-order chromatin conformation of the locus exists in both G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle and is therefore independent of cohesin's function in sister chromatid cohesion. We propose that cohesin can mediate interactions between DNA molecules in cis to insulate genes through the formation of chromatin loops, analogous to the cohesin mediated interaction with sister chromatids in trans to establish cohesion.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} There are few detailed clinical reports about extrahepatic metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the clinical features of extrahepatic metastases of HCC. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} The clinical records of 482 patients who had been diagnosed as having HCC during the period from January 1995 to March 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. Extrahepatic metastases had been detected in 65 patients. Clinical features of those 65 patients were analyzed. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Patients with extrahepatic metastases had more advanced intrahepatic tumors at the first diagnosis of HCC: 73.8\% of the patients with extrahepatic metastases had tumors of intrahepatic tumor stage T3 or T4 according to the TNM classification, while only 28.5\% of the patients without extrahepatic metastases had tumors of T3 or T4 (P~{$<~$}0.001). Vessel invasion was also detected at the first diagnosis of HCC more frequently in the patients with extrahepatic metastasis (P~{$<~$}0.001). The frequent metastatic sites were lung (53.8\%), bone (38.5\%), and lymph node (33.8\%). Other metastatic sites were the adrenal gland, peritoneum, skin, brain and muscle. The median survival time and 1-year survival rate were 7~months (range: 1\textendash 59~months) and 24.9\%, respectively. Patients with Child\textendash Pugh grade B and C (P~=~0.0018) and patients with positive serum {$\alpha$}-fetoprotein (P~=~0.011) had significantly poor prognosis. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Extrahepatic metastases of HCC are not rare. The possibility of extrahepatic metastases and the clinical features of extrahepatic metastases should be considered when examining patients with HCC, particularly those with advanced intrahepatic tumors, to enable precise evaluation of the spread of HCC and determination of the appropriate treatment method. \textcopyright{} 2005 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd},

  abstract = {Four different histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4; two subunits each) constitute a histone octamer, around which DNA wraps to form histone-DNA complexes called nucleosomes. Amino acid residues in each histone are occasionally modified, resulting in several biological effects, including differential regulation of transcription. Core promoters that encompass the transcription start site have well-conserved DNA motifs, including the initiator (Inr), TATA box, and DPE, which are collectively called the core promoter elements (CPEs). In this study, we systematically studied the associations between the CPEs and histone modifications by integrating the Drosophila Core Promoter Database and time-series ChIP-seq data for histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3) during development in Drosophila melanogaster via the modENCODE project. We classified 96 core promoters into four groups based on the presence or absence of the TATA box or DPE, calculated the histone modification ratio at the core promoter region, and transcribed region for each core promoter. We found that the histone modifications in TATA-less groups were static during development and that the core promoters could be clearly divided into three types: i) core promoters with continuous active marks (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac), ii) core promoters with a continuous inactive mark (H3K27me3) and occasional active marks, and iii) core promoters with occasional histone modifications. Linear regression analysis and non-linear regression by random forest showed that the TATA-containing groups included core promoters without histone modifications, for which the measured RNA expression values were not predictable accurately from the histone modification status. DPE-containing groups had a higher relative frequency of H3K27me3 in both the core promoter region and transcribed region. In summary, our analysis showed that there was a systematic link between the existence of the CPEs and the dynamics, frequency and influence on transcriptional activity of histone modifications.},

  abstract = {A systematic analysis of protein staining in polyacrylamide gels with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) R-250 and G-250 using a high resolution densitometer allowing for quantitative measurements during staining and destaining has revealed that none of the published procedures allows quantitative measurements. Protein staining with CBB R-250 in methanol/water/acetic acid is poor, as is staining with CBB G-250 in trichloroacetic acid or perchloric acid, the latter two, however, allowing for a weak background staining. Consequently using the colloidal properties of the CBB dyes, stronger for G-250 than for R-250, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of protein staining to a detection limit of 0.7 ng bovine serum albumin/mm2 gel. In addition, sensitive protein staining on a clear background is possible. Recipes are described (Section 3.11) for intensified protein staining with CBB G-250 using trichloroacetic acid or perchloric acid on a clear background. Optimal staining of proteins on a clear background can be performed with phosphoric acid and CBB G-250 in the presence of ammonium sulfate since under these conditions the colloidal state of the dye is optimized. Furthermore, conditions are described which allow the stable fixation of the protein-dye complex. Combining the optimized staining conditions with the stable fixation in 20\% ammonium sulfate allows for stepwise staining for e. g. detection of weak spots in addition to intense protein spots. The dependence of different staining procedures on gel thickness, gel concentration and compounds routinely used in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is also analysed. Calibration curves and application of the new procedure to biological material demonstrate its wide applicability. Convincing arguments for the colloidal properties of the CBB dyes are presented, formulating the rationale for intensified protein staining with CBB dyes in polyacrylamide gels without background staining.},

  abstract = {Many mammalian genes are transcribed during short bursts of variable frequencies and sizes that substantially contribute to cell-to-cell variability. However, which molecular mechanisms determine bursting properties remains unclear. To probe putative mechanisms, we combined temporal analysis of transcription along the circadian cycle with multiple genomic reporter integrations, using both short-lived luciferase live microscopy and single-molecule RNA-FISH. Using the Bmal1 circadian promoter as our model, we observed that rhythmic transcription resulted predominantly from variations in burst frequency, while the genomic position changed the burst size. Thus, burst frequency and size independently modulated Bmal1 transcription. We then found that promoter histone-acetylation level covaried with burst frequency, being greatest at peak expression and lowest at trough expression, while remaining unaffected by the genomic location. In addition, specific deletions of ROR-responsive elements led to constitutively elevated histone acetylation and burst frequency. We then investigated the suggested link between histone acetylation and burst frequency by dCas9p300-targeted modulation of histone acetylation, revealing that acetylation levels influence burst frequency more than burst size. The correlation between acetylation levels at the promoter and burst frequency was also observed in endogenous circadian genes and in embryonic stem cell fate genes. Thus, our data suggest that histone acetylation-mediated control of transcription burst frequency is a common mechanism to control mammalian gene expression.},

Genome-wide analysis reveals TFIIIC with Pol III at all tRNA genes, many of which cluster at pericentromeric heterochromatin domain boundaries. However, a single tRNA(phe) gene with modest TFIIIC enrichment is insufficient to serve as boundary and requires RNAi-associated element to restrain heterochromatin spreading. Remarkably, we found TFIIIC localization without Pol III at many sites located between divergent promoters. These sites appear to act as chromosome-organizing clamps by tethering distant loci to the nuclear periphery, at which TFIIIC is concentrated into several distinct bodies.

Using the auxin-inducible degron system in mouse embryonic stem cells, we show that CTCF is absolutely and dose-dependently required for looping between CTCF target sites and insulation of topologically associating domains (TADs). Restoring CTCF reinstates proper architecture on altered chromosomes, indicating a powerful instructive function for CTCF in~chromatin folding. CTCF remains essential for TAD organization in non-dividing cells. Surprisingly, active and inactive genome compartments remain properly segregated upon CTCF depletion, revealing that compartmentalization of mammalian chromosomes emerges independently of proper insulation of TADs. Furthermore, our data support that CTCF mediates transcriptional insulator function through enhancer blocking but not as a direct barrier to heterochromatin spreading. Beyond defining the functions of CTCF in chromosome folding, these results provide new fundamental insights into the rules governing mammalian genome organization.},

Tumor cell populations are apparently more genetically unstable than normal cells, perhaps from activation of specific gene loci in the neoplasm, continued presence of carcinogen, or even nutritional deficiencies within the tumor. The acquired genetic insta0ility and associated selection process, most readily recognized cytogenetically, results in advanced human malignancies being highly individual karyotypically and biologically. Hence, each patient's cancer may require individual specific therapy, and even this may be thwarted by emergence of a genetically variant subline resistant to the treatment. More research should be directed toward understanding and controlling the evolutionary process in tumors before it reaches the late stage usually seen in clinical cancer.},

This device utilizes compressed air from a commercial airgun to propel macroprojectile and DNA-coated tungsten particles. The {$\beta$}-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene was used to monitor transient expression in three distinct cell types of maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa), and wheat (Triticum aestivum). The highest level of GUS activity in cultured maize cells was observed when distance between stopping plate and target cells was adjusted to 4.3 centimeters. Efficiency of transformation was estimated to be 4.4 \texttimes{} 10-3. In a partial vacuum of 700 millimeters Hg, velocity of macroprojectile was measured at 520 meters per second with a 6\% reduction in velocity at atmospheric pressure. A polyethylene film placed in the breech before firing contributed to a 12\% increase in muzzle velocity. A 700 millimeters Hg level of vacuum was necessary for maximum number of transfornants. GUS expression was also detected in wheat leaf base tissue of microdissected shoot apices. High levels of transient gene expression were also observed in hard, compact embryogenic callus of rice. These results show that the airgun apparatus is a convenient, safe, and low-cost device for rapid transient gene expression studies in cereals.},

Diolistics is also ideal for loading cells with optical nanosensors--nanometre-sized sensors linked to fluorescent probes. Here, we discuss the theoretical considerations of using diolistics, the advantages compared with other methods of inserting dyes into cells and the current uses of the technique, with particular consideration of nanosensors.},

  abstract = {Background: Invasive growth of epithelial tumor cells, a major cause of death from cancer in humans, involves loss of epithelial polarity and dedifferentiation. Transforming growth factor {$\beta$} (TGF{$\beta$}) is regarded as a major tumor suppressor during early tumor development because it inhibits cell-cycle progression and tumor growth. Many dedifferentiated, late-stage tumors are resistant to growth inhibition by TGF{$\beta$}, however, and even secrete TGF{$\beta$}. In line with this, TGF{$\beta$} is involved in angiogenesis, wound healing and epithelial\textendash mesenchymal transition (EMT) during development. Ha-Ras-transformed mammary epithelial cells (EpRas) undergo TGF{$\beta$}-induced EMT maintained via a TGF{$\beta$} autocrine loop. Thus, we have analyzed whether signal transduction by the TGF{$\beta$} receptor (TGF{$\beta$}R) is required for local tumor cell invasion and metastasis., Results: A dominant-negative type II TGF{$\beta$}R (TGF{$\beta$}RII-dn) was expressed using retroviral vectors in EpRas cells and highly metastatic mesenchymal mouse colon carcinoma cells (CT26). In both cell types, TGF{$\beta$}RII-dn blocked TGF{$\beta$}R signaling and heavily delayed tumor formation. In EpRas cells, TGF{$\beta$}RII-dn prevented EMT. In the dedifferentiated mesenchymal CT26 cells, TGF{$\beta$}RII-dn caused mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and inhibited their in vitro invasiveness in several assays. In addition, TGF{$\beta$}RII-dn completely abolished metastasis formation by CT26 cells. Furthermore, several human carcinoma lines lost in vitro invasiveness when treated with neutralizing TGF{$\beta$} antibodies or soluble receptor variants. Finally, human colon carcinoma cells (hnPCC) expressing a mutated, non-functional TGF{$\beta$}RII were non-invasive in vitro, a defect restored by re-expressing wild-type TGF{$\beta$}RII., Conclusions: Cell-autonomous TGF{$\beta$} signaling is required for both induction and maintenance of in vitro invasiveness and metastasis during late-stage tumorigenesis. TGF{$\beta$}RII therefore represents a potential target for therapeutical intervention in human tumorigenesis.},

In some cases, specific enhancer\textendash promoter interactions depend on promoter competition, whereby the activation of a preferred target promoter precludes expression of linked genes. Here, we employ a transgenic embryo assay to obtain evidence that promoter selection is influenced by the TATA element. Both the AE1 enhancer from the Drosophila Antennapedia gene complex (ANT-C) and the IAB5 enhancer from the Bithorax complex (BX-C) preferentially activate TATA-containing promoters when challenged with linked TATA-less promoters. In contrast, the rho neuroectoderm enhancer (NEE) does not discriminate between these two classes of promoters. Thus, certain upstream activators, such as Ftz, prefer TATA-containing promoters, whereas other activators, including Dorsal, work equally well on both classes of promoters. These results provide in vivo evidence that different core promoters possess distinct regulatory activities. We discuss the possibility that an invariant TFIID complex can adopt different conformations on the core promoter.},

  abstract = {Liver cancers, including hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), cholangiocarcinomas (CCs), and fibrolamellar HCCs (FL-HCCs) are among the most common cancers worldwide and are associated with a poor prognosis. Investigations of genes important in liver cancers have focused on Sal-like protein 4 (SALL4), a member of a family of zinc finger transcription factors. It is a regulator of embryogenesis, organogenesis, pluripotency, can elicit reprogramming of somatic cells, and is a marker of stem cells. We found it expressed in normal murine hepatoblasts, normal human hepatic stem cells, hepatoblasts and biliary tree stem cells, but not in mature parenchymal cells of liver or biliary tree. It was strongly expressed in surgical specimens of human HCCs, CCs, a combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma, a FL-HCC, and in derivative, transplantable tumor lines in immune-compromised hosts. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that elevated expression of SALL4 in tumors is associated with poor survival of HCC patients. Experimental manipulation of SALL4{${'}$}s expression results in changes in proliferation versus differentiation in human HCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo in immune-compromised hosts. Virus-mediated gene transfer of SALL4 was used for gain- and loss-of-function analyses in the cell lines. Significant growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by an increase in differentiation occurred with down-regulation of SALL4. Overexpression of SALL4 resulted in increased cell proliferation in vitro, correlating with an increase in expression of cytokeratin19 (CK19), epithelial cell adhesion molecules (EpCAM), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette-G2 (ABCG2). Conclusion: SALL4{${'}$}s expression is an indicator of stem cells, a prognostic marker in liver cancers, correlates with cell and tumor growth, with resistance to 5-FU, and its suppression results in differentiation and slowed tumor growth. SALL4 is a novel therapeutic target for liver cancers. (HEPATOLOGY 2013)},

The purpose of this study was to clarify the characteristics of poorly differentiated HCC in hepatectomized patients. Methods From 1986 to 2001, 354 HCC patients underwent curative hepatectomy in our institution and were prospectively followed. Histological examinations revealed 43 well-differentiated HCC tumors, 273 moderately differentiated HCC tumors, and 38 poorly differentiated HCC tumors. Clinicopathologic factors and outcomes after hepatectomy were compared statistically. Results Only serum alpha-fetoprotein level was significantly different in the poorly differentiated HCC group from that in the moderately differentiated HCC group preoperatively (P\,=\,0.0001). Although there were no significant differences between overall survival rates or between disease-free survival rates in the three groups, distant metastasis within 2 years after hepatectomy occurred more frequently in the poorly differentiated HCC group (21\%) than in the well-differentiated HCC group (2\%) (P\,=\,0.011) or moderately differentiated HCC group (8\%) (P\,=\,0.018). Distant metastasis occurred in about 40\% of patients in the poorly differentiated HCC group with tumor size greater than 3 cm. Conclusions Poorly differentiated HCC tumors larger than 3 cm are already of advanced stage representing distant metastasis in the early period after hepatectomy. J. Surg.

The approach is analogous to a powerful method of bacterial genetics, the random generation of operon fusions, that enables the isolation and characterization of genes simply by knowing or postulating their pattern of expression; it is not necessary initially to screen for mutant phenotypes. To apply this approach to Drosophila, we have used the expression of the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli from the P-element promoter in germ-line transformant flies to screen for chromosomal elements that can act at a distance to stimulate expression from this apparently weak promoter. Of 49 transformed fly lines obtained, approximately 70\% show some type of spatially regulated expression of the lacZ gene in embryos; many of these express lacZ specifically in the nervous system. The P-lacZ fusion gene is, therefore, an efficient tool for the recovery of elements that may regulate gene expression in Drosophila and for the generation of a wide variety of cell-type-specific markers.},

It is generated from ATP and fructose-6-phosphate by 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase and degraded to fructose-6-phosphate and phosphate ion by fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase. In most organisms these enzymatic activities are contained in a single polypeptide. The reciprocal modulation of the kinase and bisphosphatase activities by post-translational modifications places the level of the biofactor under the control of extra-cellular signals. In general, these signals are generated in response to changing nutritional states, therefore, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate plays a role in the adaptation of organisms, and the tissues within them, to changes in environmental and metabolic states. Although the specific mechanism of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate action varies between species and between tissues, most involve the allosteric activation of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase and inhibition of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. These highly conserved enzymes regulate the fructose-6-phosphate/fructose-1,6-bisphosphate cycle, and thereby, determine the carbon flux. It is by reciprocal modulation of these activities that fructose-2,6-bisphosphate plays a fundamental role in eukaryotic carbohydrate metabolism.},

The RefSeq project leverages the data submitted to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) against a combination of computation, manual curation, and collaboration to produce a standard set of stable, non-redundant reference sequences. The RefSeq project augments these reference sequences with current knowledge including publications, functional features and informative nomenclature. The database currently represents sequences from more than 55,000 organisms ({$>$}4800 viruses, {$>$}40,000 prokaryotes and {$>$}10,000 eukaryotes; RefSeq release 71), ranging from a single record to complete genomes. This paper summarizes the current status of the viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic branches of the RefSeq project, reports on improvements to data access and details efforts to further expand the taxonomic representation of the collection. We also highlight diverse functional curation initiatives that support multiple uses of RefSeq data including taxonomic validation, genome annotation, comparative genomics, and clinical testing. We summarize our approach to utilizing available RNA-Seq and other data types in our manual curation process for vertebrate, plant, and other species, and describe a new direction for prokaryotic genomes and protein name management.},

  abstract = {The immense majority of genes are alternatively spliced and there are many isoforms specifically associated with cancer progression and metastasis. The splicing pattern of specific isoforms of numerous genes is altered as cells move through the oncogenic process of gaining proliferative capacity, acquiring angiogenic, invasive, antiapoptotic and survival properties, becoming free from growth factor dependence and growth suppression, altering their metabolism to cope with hypoxia, enabling them to acquire mechanisms of immune escape, and as they move through the epithelial\textendash mesenchymal and mesenchymal\textendash epithelial transitions and metastasis. Each of the `hallmarks of cancer' is associated with a switch in splicing, towards a more aggressive invasive cancer phenotype. The choice of isoforms is regulated by several factors (signaling molecules, kinases, splicing factors) currently being identified systematically by a number of high-throughput, independent and unbiased methodologies. Splicing factors are de-regulated in cancer, and in some cases are themselves oncogenes or pseudo-oncogenes and can contribute to positive feedback loops driving cancer progression. Tumour progression may therefore be associated with a coordinated splicing control, meaning that there is the potential for a relatively small number of splice factors or their regulators to drive multiple oncogenic processes. The understanding of how splicing contributes to the various phenotypic traits acquired by tumours as they progress and metastasise, and in particular how alternative splicing is coordinated, can and is leading to the development of a new class of anticancer therapeutics\textemdash the alternative-splicing inhibitors.},

Biochemical reactions that involve small numbers of molecules are intrinsically noisy, being dominated by large concentration fluctuations. This intrinsic noise has been implicated in the random lysis/lysogeny decision of bacteriophage-lambda, in the loss of synchrony of circadian clocks and in the decrease of precision of cell signals. We sought to quantitatively investigate the extent to which the occurrence of molecular fluctuations within single cells (biochemical noise) could explain the variation of gene expression levels between cells in a genetically identical population (phenotypic noise). We have isolated the biochemical contribution to phenotypic noise from that of other noise sources by carrying out a series of differential measurements. We varied independently the rates of transcription and translation of a single fluorescent reporter gene in the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis, and we quantitatively measured the resulting changes in the phenotypic noise characteristics. We report that of these two parameters, increased translational efficiency is the predominant source of increased phenotypic noise. This effect is consistent with a stochastic model of gene expression in which proteins are produced in random and sharp bursts. Our results thus provide the first direct experimental evidence of the biochemical origin of phenotypic noise, demonstrating that the level of phenotypic variation in an isogenic population can be regulated by genetic parameters.},

CGIs control transcription initiation by conferring nearby promoters with unique chromatin properties. In addition, there are thousands of distal or orphan CGIs (oCGIs) whose functional relevance is barely known. Here we show that oCGIs are an essential component of poised enhancers that augment their long-range regulatory activity and control the responsiveness of their target genes. Using a knock-in strategy in mouse embryonic stem cells, we introduced poised enhancers with or without oCGIs within topologically associating domains harboring genes with different types of promoters. Analysis of the resulting cell lines revealed that oCGIs act as tethering elements that promote the physical and functional communication between poised enhancers and distally located genes, particularly those with large CGI clusters in their promoters. Therefore, by acting as genetic determinants of gene\textendash enhancer compatibility, CGIs can contribute to gene expression control under both physiological and potentially pathological conditions.},

RNAi represents a conserved regulatory motif, which is present in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms. Recently, we and others have shown that endogenously encoded triggers of gene silencing act through elements of the RNAi machinery to regulate the expression of protein-coding genes. These small temporal RNAs (stRNAs) are transcribed as short hairpin precursors ({$\sim$}70 nt), processed into active, 21-nt RNAs by Dicer, and recognize target mRNAs via base-pairing interactions. Here, we show that short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) can be engineered to suppress the expression of desired genes in cultured Drosophila and mammalian cells. shRNAs can be synthesized exogenously or can be transcribed from RNA polymerase III promoters in vivo, thus permitting the construction of continuous cell lines or transgenic animals in which RNAi enforces stable and heritable gene silencing.},

In general, success or failure of standard clinical radiation treatment is determined by the 4 R's of radiobiology: repair of DNA damage, redistribution of cells in the cell cycle, repopulation, and reoxygenation of hypoxic tumor areas.

We discovered that genetic or chemical inhibition of the ubiquitous kinase GSK3A enhances long-range interactions by dysregulating cohesin-mediated chromatin looping. Collectively, these results highlight a noncanonical role for GSK3A signaling in nuclear architecture and underscore the broader utility of HiDRO-based screening to identify novel mechanisms that drive the spatial organization of the genome.},

Here, we performed systematic chromatin and transcriptome profiling in human pancreatic islets. Integrated analysis of islet data with those from nine cell types identified specific and significant enrichment of type 2 diabetes and related quantitative trait GWAS variants in islet enhancers. Our integrated chromatin maps reveal that most enhancers are short (median = 0.8 kb). Each cell type also contains a substantial number of more extended ({$\geq$} 3 kb) enhancers. Interestingly, these stretch enhancers are often tissue-specific and overlap locus control regions, suggesting that they are important chromatin regulatory beacons. Indeed, we show that (i) tissue specificity of enhancers and nearby gene expression increase with enhancer length; (ii) neighborhoods containing stretch enhancers are enriched for important cell type-specific genes; and (iii) GWAS variants associated with traits relevant to a particular cell type are more enriched in stretch enhancers compared with short enhancers. Reporter constructs containing stretch enhancer sequences exhibited tissue-specific activity in cell culture experiments and in transgenic mice.

In postnatal Bmi-1-/- mice, the number of HSCs was markedly reduced. Transplanted fetal liver and bone marrow cells obtained from Bmi-1-/- mice were able to contribute only transiently to haematopoiesis. There was no detectable self-renewal of adult HSCs, indicating a cell autonomous defect in Bmi-1-/- mice. A gene expression analysis revealed that the expression of stem cell associated genes, cell survival genes, transcription factors, and genes modulating proliferation including p16Ink4a and p19Arf was altered in bone marrow cells of the Bmi-1-/- mice. Expression of p16Ink4a and p19Arf in normal HSCs resulted in proliferative arrest and p53-dependent cell death, respectively.

Although a large number of insulators have been isolated, it is unclear whether these elements function by shared molecular mechanisms. Novel applications of FLP recombinase technology were used to dissect and compare the function of the Drosophila gypsy and scs insulators. Inter actions between FLP monomers bound to chromosomally integrated FRT sites were unimpeded by either insulator, demonstrating that these insulators do not establish a chromosomal environment capable of disrupting all types of protein?protein interactions. The gypsy insulator blocked enhancer-activated transcription on FLP-generated extra-chromosomal episomes, whereas the scs insulator displayed silencing effects. These data indicate that these insulators differ in the mechanisms used to prevent enhancer function. That the gypsy insulator blocked enhancer?promoter communication within small episomes suggests that these effects may be accomplished without a global reorganization of chromatin structure. Instead, the gypsy insulator may disrupt enhancer-activated transcription by direct interference with transmission of the enhancer signal to the promoter.},

However, a single T-to-A substitution converts the TCT element into a functionally active Inr. Thus, the TCT motif is a novel transcriptional element that is distinct from the Inr. These findings reveal a specialized TCT-based transcription system that is directed toward the synthesis of ribosomal proteins.},

Because integrins are mechanotransducers that regulate cell fate, we asked whether tissue stiffness could promote malignant behavior by modulating integrins. We found that tumors are rigid because they have a stiff stroma and elevated Rho-dependent cytoskeletal tension that drives focal adhesions, disrupts adherens junctions, perturbs tissue polarity, enhances growth, and hinders lumen formation. Matrix stiffness perturbs epithelial morphogenesis by clustering integrins to enhance ERK activation and increase ROCK-generated contractility and focal adhesions. Contractile, EGF-transformed epithelia with elevated ERK and Rho activity could be phenotypically reverted to tissues lacking focal adhesions if Rho-generated contractility or ERK activity was decreased. Thus, ERK and Rho constitute part of an integrated mechanoregulatory circuit linking matrix stiffness to cytoskeletal tension through integrins to regulate tissue phenotype.},

Here we describe a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a conserved epitope in the homeodomain of engrailed proteins of a number of different arthropods, annelids, and chordates; we use this antibody to isolate the grasshopper engrailed gene. In Drosophila embryos, the antibody reveals engrailed protein in the posterior portion of each segment during segmentation, and in a segmentally reiterated subset of neuronal cells during neurogenesis. Other arthropods, including grasshopper and two crustaceans, have similar patterns of engrailed expression. However, these patterns of expression are not shared by the annelids or chordates we examined. Our results provide the most comprehensive view that has been obtained of how expression patterns of a regulatory gene vary during evolution. On the basis of these patterns, we suggest that engrailed is a gene whose ancestral function was in neurogenesis and whose function was co-opted during the evolution of segmentation in the arthropods, but not in the annelids and chordates.},

The scanning of the eukaryotic nuclear DNA database using this search algorithm correctly identified 933 of the 940 known tRNA genes (0.74\% of false negatives).

Some of the newly identified tRNA genes were found in rather uncommon genomic positions: 2 in centromeric regions and 3 within introns. Furthermore, the presence of extragenically located B boxes in tRNA genes from various organisms could be detected through a specific subroutine of the standard search program.},

Although relatively uncharacterized in terms of biological mechanisms, these elements are likely to be abundant in the genome. We developed an experimental strategy to identify silencers and EBs using transient transfection assays. A known insulator and EB from the chicken beta-globin locus, cHS4, served as a control element for these assays. We examined 47 sequences from a 1.8-Mb region of human chromosome 7 for silencer and EB activities. The majority of functional elements displayed directional and promoter-specific activities. A limited number of sequences acted in a dual manner, as both silencers and EBs. We examined genomic data, epigenetic modifications, and sequence motifs within these regions. Strong silencer elements contained a novel CT-rich motif, often in multiple copies. Deletion of the motif from three regions caused a measurable loss of silencing ability in these sequences. Moreover, five duplicate occurrences of this motif were identified in the cHS4 insulator. These motifs provided an explanation for an uncharacterized silencing activity we measured in the insulator element. Overall, we identified 15 novel NREs, which contribute new insights into the prevalence and composition of sequences that negatively regulate gene expression.},

Distinct combinations of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), Mediator, and cohesin show widespread enrichment in chromatin interactions at different length scales. CTCF/cohesin anchor long-range constitutive interactions that might form the topological basis for invariant subdomains. Conversely, Mediator/cohesin bridge short-range enhancer-promoter interactions within and between larger subdomains. Knockdown of Smc1 or Med12 in embryonic stem cells results in disruption of spatial architecture and downregulation of genes found in cohesin-mediated interactions.

Traditionally, localized treatment has targeted the cancer cells directly by removing them (surgery) or killing them (chemotherapy and radiation). These modes of therapy have not always been effective because many tumors recur after these therapies, either because not all of the cells are killed (local recurrence) or because the cancer cells had already escaped the primary tumor environment (distant recurrence). There has been an increasing recognition that the tumor microenvironment contains host noncancer cells in addition to cancer cells, interacting in a dynamic fashion over time. The cancer cells compete and/or cooperate with nontumor cells, and the cancer cells may compete and/or cooperate with each other. It has been demonstrated that these interactions can alter the genotype and phenotype of the host cells as well as the cancer cells. The interaction of these cancer and host cells to remodel the normal host organ microenvironment may best be conceptualized as an evolving ecosystem. In classic terms, an ecosystem describes the physical and biological components of an environment in relation to each other as a unit. Here, we review some properties of tumor microenvironments and ecological systems and indicate similarities between them. We propose that describing tumors as ecological systems defines new opportunities for novel cancer therapies and use the development of prostate cancer metastases as an example. We refer to this as ``ecological therapy'' for cancer.},

The DNA sequence containing this site has the properties of an insulator, as shown by its ability in stable transformation experiments to block enhancer\textendash promoter interaction when it lies between the two, but not when it lies outside, and to protect against position effects in Drosophila. We now show that the chicken insulator can protect a stably integrated gene, which is otherwise subject to great variability of expression, from chromatin-mediated repression in cell culture. When the integrated reporter gene is surrounded by insulator elements, stably transformed cell lines display consistent enhancer-dependent expression levels, in accord with the strength of the enhancer. In the absence of insulators, long-term nonselective propagation of cells carrying the integrated reporter gene results in gradual extinction of the reporter's expression, with expression patterns from tandemly repeated inserted genes suggesting that the extinction of adjacent genes is coupled. We show that the uninsulated reporter genes, in addition to becoming transcriptionally inactive, lose several epigenetic hallmarks of active chromatin, including nuclease accessibility, DNA hypomethylation, and histone hyperacetylation during time in culture. Treatment with inhibitors of histone deacetylase or DNA methylation reverses the extinction of the uninsulated genes. Extinction is completely prevented by flanking the reporter construct with insulators. Furthermore, in contrast to the uninsulated reporter genes, chromatin over the insulated genes retains nuclease accessibility and histone hyperacetylation. However, there is no clear correlation between the presence of the insulators and the level of DNA methylation. This leads us to propose a model for the insulator's ability to protect against extinction in the transformed cell lines and to function as a chromatin boundary for the chicken {$\beta$}-globin locus in normal erythroid cells.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Genes are expressed in stochastic transcriptional bursts linked to alternating active and inactive promoter states. A major challenge in transcription is understanding how promoter composition dictates bursting, particularly in multicellular organisms. We investigate two key Drosophila developmental promoter motifs, the TATA box (TATA) and the Initiator (INR). Using live imaging in Drosophila embryos and new computational methods, we demonstrate that bursting occurs on multiple timescales ranging from seconds to minutes. TATA-containing promoters and INR-containing promoters exhibit distinct dynamics, with one or two separate rate-limiting steps respectively. A TATA box is associated with long active states, high rates of polymerase initiation, and short-lived, infrequent inactive states. In contrast, the INR motif leads to two inactive states, one of which relates to promoter-proximal polymerase pausing. Surprisingly, the model suggests pausing is not obligatory, but occurs stochastically for a subset of polymerases. Overall, our results provide a rationale for promoter switching during zygotic genome activation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Intra-Hox transcription factor binding and distal enhancer elements have emerged as the major regulatory modes controlling Hox gene expression. However, quantifying their relative contributions has remained elusive. Here, we introduce 9synthetic regulatory reconstitution9, a novel conceptual framework for studying gene regulation and apply it to the HoxA cluster. We synthesized and delivered variant rat HoxA clusters (130-170 kilobases each) to an ectopic location in the mouse genome. We find that a HoxA cluster lacking distal enhancers recapitulates correct patterns of chromatin remodeling and transcription in response to patterning signals, while distal enhancers are required for full transcriptional output. Synthetic regulatory reconstitution is a generalizable strategy to decipher the regulatory logic of gene expression in complex genomes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

C.A.L. Bassett and R.O. Becker (1962) observed that these stress generated electrical signals decayed very slowly in comparison with similarly initiated signals in piezo-electric crystals and concluded that piezo-electric phenomena ``while probably present, were not the sole cause of these potentials''. Later analysis and experiments established that the observed signals were primarily due to ion displacement within the porous regions and multiple fluid filled channels present in all bone [Anderson and Erikson, 1970; Erikson, 1976; Piekarski and Muro, 1977; Guzelsu and Demiray, 1979; Chakkalakal et al., 1980; Gross and Williams, 1982; Pienkowski and Pollack, 1983; Grodzinsky, 1983; Pollack et al. 1984]. The early observations already suggested that direct application of an externally generated voltage might have an effect on bone development. This was shown to be the case by Bassett, Pawluk and Becker (1964) who found that a DC current of the order of 1 \textmu A (corresponding to a current density of approximately 0.01 A/m2) produced massive osteogenesis near the cathode when electrodes were implanted into the femur of living dogs.},

A core set of proteins including actin, Arp2/3 complex, profilin, capping protein, and ADF/cofilin can reconstitute the process in vitro, and mathematical models of the constituent reactions predict the rate of motion. Signaling pathways converging on WASp/Scar proteins regulate the activity of Arp2/3 complex, which mediates the initiation of new filaments as branches on preexisting filaments. After a brief spurt of growth, capping protein terminates the elongation of the filaments. After filaments have aged by hydrolysis of their bound ATP and dissociation of the gamma phosphate, ADF/cofilin proteins promote debranching and depolymerization. Profilin catalyzes the exchange of ADP for ATP, refilling the pool of ATP-actin monomers bound to profilin, ready for elongation.},

  abstract = {To regulate gene expression, enhancers must come into proximity with their target gene. At some loci the timing of enhancer-promoter proximity is uncoupled from gene activation, while at others it is tightly linked. Here, we assessed this more globally for 600 characterized enhancers or promoters (E/P) with tissue-specific activity in Drosophila embryos, by performing Capture-C and insulator ChIP in FACS-purified myogenic or neurogenic cells at different stages of embryogenesis. This high-resolution view enabled direct comparison between E/P interactions and activity across 5 developmental conditions. This revealed largely invariant E/P contacts between the blastoderm and cell fate specification stages, despite changes in activity. However, E/P interactions diverge during terminal tissue differentiation when many tissue-specific interactions are gained on top of a pre-existing topology. Changes in E/P proximity reflect changes in enhancer activity and gene activation, and are generally not accompanied by changes in insulator binding. Using transgenes and deletions, we show that many tissue-specific interactions represent functional E-P pairs. Our results reveal a shift in E-P landscapes as embryogenesis proceeds, from largely pre-formed topologies at early stages to more distal tissue-specific loops during differentiation, when E/P proximity appears coupled to activation.},

  abstract = {Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) regulates both cell growth and cellular plasticity and is therefore important in the molecular control of both the developmental and neoplastic processes. It has been suggested that TGF-beta1 may be a positive or negative regulator of tumorigenesis. Stimulation of tumorigenesis could be due to its action as an immunosuppressor or as an inducer of angiogenesis, or by its direct action on the cell in promoting cellular plasticity. In the current study, we provide evidence that TGF-beta1 can act directly on keratinocytes in vivo to induce the reversible epithelial-mesenchymal conversion of a malignant metastatic keratinocyte cell line. Two squamous clones from the cell line were shown to undergo a reversible conversion to a fibroblastoid phenotype after culture in 1 ng/ml TGF-beta1. The morphological conversion became apparent at 24 h post-TGF-beta treatment and was complete after another 24 h. The conversion was characterized by a rapid delocalization of E-cadherin within 6-12 h posttreatment, followed by down-regulation of E-cadherin levels by 72 h. These squamous clones spontaneously converted to a fibroblastoid phenotype after s.c. injection in nude mice. Importantly, four of four clones that had been stably transfected with a dominant negative TGF-beta type II receptor were unable to undergo this mesenchymal switch in vivo, despite the fact that all clones stably transfected with neomyocin resistance alone retained their spindle characteristics in vivo. This demonstrates that the epithelial-mesenchymal conversion event is mediated directly via the TGF-beta signaling pathway of the tumor cell per se, and that it is sufficient to significantly enhance tumorigenicity and the malignant and invasive characteristics of the tumor in vivo.},

RNA interference (RNAi)-based loss-of-function screening has proven powerful for the identification of new and interesting cancer targets, and recent studies have used this technology in vivo to identify novel tumour suppressor genes. Here we developed a method for identifying novel cancer targets via negative-selection RNAi screening using a human breast cancer xenograft model at an orthotopic site in the mouse. Using this method, we screened a set of metabolic genes associated with aggressive breast cancer and stemness to identify those required for in vivo tumorigenesis. Among the genes identified, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) is in a genomic region of recurrent copy number gain in breast cancer and PHGDH protein levels are elevated in 70\% of oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancers. PHGDH catalyses the first step in the serine biosynthesis pathway, and breast cancer cells with high PHGDH expression have increased serine synthesis flux. Suppression of PHGDH in cell lines with elevated PHGDH expression, but not in those without, causes a strong decrease in cell proliferation and a reduction in serine synthesis. We find that PHGDH suppression does not affect intracellular serine levels, but causes a drop in the levels of {$\alpha$}-ketoglutarate, another output of the pathway and a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate. In cells with high PHGDH expression, the serine synthesis pathway contributes approximately 50\% of the total anaplerotic flux of glutamine into the TCA cycle. These results reveal that certain breast cancers are dependent upon increased serine pathway flux caused by PHGDH overexpression and demonstrate the utility of in vivo negative-selection RNAi screens for finding potential anticancer targets.},

Gene duplication is thought to promote such innovation. Vertebrate ancestors probably had single copies of genes now found in multiple copies in vertebrates and gene maps suggest that this occurred by polyploidization. It has been suggested that one genome duplication event occurred before, and one after the divergence of ray-finned and lobe-finned fishes. Holland et al., however, have argued that because various vertebrates have several HOX clusters, two rounds of duplication occurred before the origin of jawed fishes. Such gene-number data, however, do not distinguish between tandem duplications and polyploidization events, nor whether independent duplications occurred in different lineages. To investigate these matters, we mapped 144 zebrafish genes and compared the resulting map with mammalian maps. Comparison revealed large conserved chromosome segments. Because duplicated chromosome segments in zebrafish often correspond with specific chromosome segments in mammals, it is likely that two polyploidization events occurred prior to the divergence of fish and mammal lineages. This zebrafish gene map will facilitate molecular identification of mutated zebrafish genes, which can suggest functions for human genes known only by sequence.},

The activity of an enhancer varies among cells of a tissue, but collectively, expression levels in individual cells constitute a spatial pattern of gene expression. How the spatial and quantitative regulatory information is encoded in an enhancer sequence is elusive. To link spatial pattern and activity levels of an enhancer, we used systematic mutations of the yellow spot enhancer, active in developing Drosophila wings, and tested their effect in a reporter assay. Moreover, we developed an analytic framework based on the comprehensive quantification of spatial reporter activity. We show that the quantitative enhancer activity results from densely packed regulatory information along the sequence, and that a complex interplay between activators and multiple tiers of repressors carves the spatial pattern. Our results shed light on how an enhancer reads and integrates trans-regulatory landscape information to encode a spatial quantitative pattern. A high density of regulatory information encodes a quantitative spatial pattern in a Drosophila transcriptional enhancer.

Additionally, the insulated organization of OR-enhancers around an OR allele is a hallmark of the chosen OR. However, the biology guiding OR choice itself is unclear. Innovations in single-cell and biophysics-based analysis of nuclear architecture are revising previous models of the nucleus to include its dynamic and probabilistic nature. In this review, we ground current knowledge of OR gene regulation in these emerging theories to speculate on mechanisms that may give rise to diverse and singular OR expression.},

  abstract = {Multiple mechanisms have evolved to regulate the eukaryotic genome. We have identified CTN-RNA, a mouse tissue-specific approximately 8 kb nuclear-retained poly(A)+ RNA that regulates the level of its protein-coding partner. CTN-RNA is transcribed from the protein-coding mouse cationic amino acid transporter 2 (mCAT2) gene through alternative promoter and poly(A) site usage. CTN-RNA is diffusely distributed in nuclei and is also localized to paraspeckles. The 3'UTR of CTN-RNA contains elements for adenosine-to-inosine editing, involved in its nuclear retention. Interestingly, knockdown of CTN-RNA also downregulates mCAT2 mRNA. Under stress, CTN-RNA is posttranscriptionally cleaved to produce protein-coding mCAT2 mRNA. Our findings reveal a role of the cell nucleus in harboring RNA molecules that are not immediately needed to produce proteins but whose cytoplasmic presence is rapidly required upon physiologic stress. This mechanism of action highlights an important paradigm for the role of a nuclear-retained stable RNA transcript in regulating gene expression.},

  abstract = {Understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms governing the evolution of morphology is a major challenge in biology. Because most animals share a conserved repertoire of body-building and -patterning genes, morphological diversity appears to evolve primarily through changes in the deployment of these genes during development. The complex expression patterns of developmentally regulated genes are typically controlled by numerous independent cis-regulatory elements (CREs). It has been proposed that morphological evolution relies predominantly on changes in the architecture of gene regulatory networks and in particular on functional changes within CREs. Here, we discuss recent experimental studies that support this hypothesis and reveal some unanticipated features of how regulatory evolution occurs. From this growing body of evidence, we identify three key operating principles underlying regulatory evolution, that is, how regulatory evolution: (i) uses available genetic components in the form of preexisting and active transcription factors and CREs to generate novelty; (ii) minimizes the penalty to overall fitness by introducing discrete changes in gene expression; and (iii) allows interactions to arise among any transcription factor and downstream CRE. These principles endow regulatory evolution with a vast creative potential that accounts for both relatively modest morphological differences among closely related species and more profound anatomical divergences among groups at higher taxonomical levels.},

The insertion of PB transposons into the genome can disrupt genes or regulatory regions, impacting cellular function, so for many experiments it is important that PB transposition is tightly controlled. Here, we systematically characterize three methods for the post-translational control of the PB transposon in four cell lines. We investigated fusions of the PB transposase with ERT2 and two degradation domains (FKBP-DD, DHFR-DD), in multiple orientations, and determined (i) the fold-induction achieved, (ii) the absolute transposition efficiency of the activated construct and (iii) the effects of two inducer molecules on cellular transcription and function. We found that the FKBP-DD confers the PB transposase with a higher transposition activity and better dynamic range than can be achieved with the other systems. In addition, we found that the FKBP-DD regulates transposon activity in a reversible and dose-dependent manner. Finally, we showed that Shld1, the chemical inducer of FKBP-DD, does not interfere with stem cell differentiation, whereas tamoxifen has significant effects. We believe the FKBP-based PB transposon induction will be useful for transposon-mediated genome engineering, insertional mutagenesis and the genome-wide mapping of transcription factor binding.},

In previous studies, downregulation of annexin A10 was correlated with dedifferentiation, invasion, and tumor progression, pointing to a possible tumor suppressor role. However, the biochemical characteristics and functions of annexin A10 remain unknown. We show that annexin A10 displays biochemical characteristics atypical for an annexin, indicating a Ca(2+)- and membrane-binding-independent function. Annexin A10 co-localizes with the mRNA-binding proteins SFPQ and PSPC1 at paraspeckles, an only recently discovered nuclear body, and decreases paraspeckle numbers when overexpressed in HeLa cells. In addition, annexin A10 relocates to dark perinucleolar caps upon transcriptional inhibition of RNA polymerase II. We mapped the cap-binding function of annexin A10 to the proximal part of the core domain, which is missing in the short isoform of annexin A10, and show its independence from the remaining functional type II Ca(2+)-binding site. In contrast to this, paraspeckle recruitment required additional core regions and was negatively affected by the mutation of the last type II Ca(2+)-binding site. Additionally, we show that overexpression of annexin A10 in HeLa cells increases their sensitivity to apoptosis and reduces colony formation. The identification of unique nuclear and biochemical characteristics of annexin A10 points towards its membrane-independent role in paraspeckle-associated mRNA regulation or processing.},

In this study, human tDNA genes are shown to function as insulators capable of blocking enhancer activity and preventing the spread of silenced chromatin., Insulators help separate active chromatin domains from silenced ones. In yeast, gene promoters act as insulators to block the spread of Sir and HP1 mediated silencing while in metazoans most insulators are multipartite autonomous entities. tDNAs are repetitive sequences dispersed throughout the human genome and we now show that some of these tDNAs can function as insulators in human cells. Using computational methods, we identified putative human tDNA insulators. Using silencer blocking, transgene protection and repressor blocking assays we show that some of these tDNA-containing fragments can function as barrier insulators in human cells. We find that these elements also have the ability to block enhancers from activating RNA pol II transcribed promoters. Characterization of a putative tDNA insulator in human cells reveals that the site possesses chromatin signatures similar to those observed at other better-characterized eukaryotic insulators. Enhanced 4C analysis demonstrates that the tDNA insulator makes long-range chromatin contacts with other tDNAs and ETC sites but not with intervening or flanking RNA pol II transcribed genes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcription initiation is a key component in the regulation of gene expression. mRNA 5' full-length sequencing techniques have enhanced our understanding of mammalian transcription start sites (TSSs), revealing different initiation patterns on a genomic scale. RESULTS: To identify TSSs in Drosophila melanogaster, we applied a hierarchical clustering strategy on available 5' expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and identified a high quality set of 5,665 TSSs for approximately 4,000 genes. We distinguished two initiation patterns: 'peaked' TSSs, and 'broad' TSS cluster groups. Peaked promoters were found to contain location-specific sequence elements; conversely, broad promoters were associated with non-location-specific elements. In alignments across other Drosophila genomes, conservation levels of sequence elements exceeded 90\% within the melanogaster subgroup, but dropped considerably for distal species. Elements in broad promoters had lower levels of conservation than those in peaked promoters. When characterizing the distributions of ESTs, 64\% of TSSs showed distinct associations to one out of eight different spatiotemporal conditions. Available whole-genome tiling array time series data revealed different temporal patterns of embryonic activity across the majority of genes with distinct alternative promoters. Many genes with maternally inherited transcripts were found to have alternative promoters utilized later in development. Core promoters of maternally inherited transcripts showed differences in motif composition compared to zygotically active promoters. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a comprehensive map of Drosophila TSSs and the conditions under which they are utilized. Distinct differences in motif associations with initiation pattern and spatiotemporal utilization illustrate the complex regulatory code of transcription initiation.},

We investigated the origins of these variations in mammalian cells by counting individual molecules of mRNA produced from a reporter gene that was stably integrated into the cell's genome. We found that there are massive variations in the number of mRNA molecules present in each cell. These variations occur because mRNAs are synthesized in short but intense bursts of transcription beginning when the gene transitions from an inactive to an active state and ending when they transition back to the inactive state. We show that these transitions are intrinsically random and not due to global, extrinsic factors such as the levels of transcriptional activators. Moreover, the gene activation causes burst-like expression of all genes within a wider genomic locus. We further found that bursts are also exhibited in the synthesis of natural genes. The bursts of mRNA expression can be buffered at the protein level by slow protein degradation rates. A stochastic model of gene activation and inactivation was developed to explain the statistical properties of the bursts. The model showed that increasing the level of transcription factors increases the average size of the bursts rather than their frequency. These results demonstrate that gene expression in mammalian cells is subject to large, intrinsically random fluctuations and raise questions about how cells are able to function in the face of such noise.},

Furthermore, we explore methods to ``unpack the black box'' to determine in an unbiased manner which structural features of chromatin regulation are most important for gene expression state. We apply this approach to an Optical Reconstruction of Chromatin Architecture dataset of the Bithorax gene cluster in Drosophila and show it outperforms previous contact-focused methods in predicting expression state from 3D structure. We find the structural information is distributed across the domain, overlapping and extending beyond domains identified by prior genetic analyses.

A diverse repertoire of protein isoforms arising from alternative splicing is expressed in ES cells without defined biological roles. Sall4, a transcription factor essential for pluripotency, exists as two isoforms (Sall4a and Sall4b). Both isoforms can form homodimers and a heterodimer with each other, and each can interact with Nanog. By genomewide location analysis, we determined that Sall4a and Sall4b have overlapping, but not identical binding sites within the ES cell genome. In addition, Sall4b, but not Sall4a, binds preferentially to highly expressed loci in ES cells. Sall4a and Sall4b binding sites are distinguished by both epigenetic marks at target loci and their clustering with binding sites of other pluripotency factors. When ES cells expressing a single isoform of Sall4 are generated, Sall4b alone could maintain the pluripotent state, although it could not completely suppress all differentiation markers. Sall4a and Sall4b collaborate in maintenance of the pluripotent state but play distinct roles. Our work is novel in establishing such isoform-specific differences in ES cells.},

Loop anchors typically occur at domain boundaries and bind CTCF. CTCF sites at loop anchors occur predominantly ({$>$}90\%) in a convergent orientation, with the asymmetric motifs ``facing'' one another.

To measure the noise intrinsic to eukaryotic gene expression, we quantified the differences in expression of two alleles in a diploid cell.

We propose a model in which the balance between promoter activation and transcription influences the variability in messenger RNA levels. To confirm the predictions of our model, we identified both cis- and trans-acting mutations that alter the noise of gene expression. These mutations suggest that noise is an evolvable trait that can be optimized to balance fidelity and diversity in eukaryotic gene expression.},

Here, we measure chromatin accessibility in isolated neural and mesodermal lineages across a time course of Drosophila embryogenesis. Promoters, including tissue-specific genes, are often constitutively open, even in contexts where the gene is not expressed. In contrast, the majority of distal elements have dynamic, tissue-specific accessibility. Enhancer priming appears rarely within a lineage, perhaps reflecting the speed of Drosophila embryogenesis. However, many tissue-specific enhancers are accessible in other lineages early on and become progressively closed as embryogenesis proceeds. We demonstrate the usefulness of this tissue- and time-resolved resource to definitively identify single-cell clusters, to uncover predictive motifs, and to identify many regulators of tissue development. For one such predicted neural regulator, l(3)neo38, we generate a loss-of-function mutant and uncover an essential role for neuromuscular junction and brain development.},

  abstract = {In roots two distinct polar movements of auxin have been reported that may control different developmental and growth events. To test the hypothesis that auxin derived from the shoot and transported toward the root controls lateral root development, the two polarities of auxin transport were uncoupled in Arabidopsis. Local application of the auxin-transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) at the root-shoot junction decreased the number and density of lateral roots and reduced the free indoleacetic acid (IAA) levels in the root and [3H]IAA transport into the root. Application of NPA to the basal half of or at several positions along the root only reduced lateral root density in regions that were in contact with NPA or in regions apical to the site of application. Lateral root development was restored by application of IAA apical to NPA application. Lateral root development in Arabidopsis roots was also inhibited by excision of the shoot or dark growth and this inhibition was reversible by IAA. Together, these results are consistent with auxin transport from the shoot into the root controlling lateral root development. Lateral root (LR) formation in vascular plants is regulated by auxin. The mechanisms of LR formation are not fully understood. Here, we have identified a novel recessive mutation in Arabidopsis thaliana, named fewer roots (fwr), that drastically reduces the number of LRs. Expression analyses of DR5::GUS, an auxin response reporter, and pLBD16::GUS, an LR initiation marker, suggested that FWR is necessary for the establishment of an auxin response maximum in LR initiation sites. We further identified that the fwr phenotypes are caused by a missense mutation in the GNOM gene, encoding an Arf-GEF (ADP ribosylation factor-GDP/GTP exchange factor), which regulates the recycling of PINs, the auxin efflux carriers. The fwr roots showed enhanced sensitivity to brefeldin A in a root growth inhibition assay, indicating that the fwr mutation reduces the Arf-GEF activity of GNOM. However, the other developmental processes except for LR formation appeared to be unaffected in the fwr mutant, indicating that fwr is a weaker allele of gnom compared with the other gnom alleles with pleiotropic phenotypes. The localization of PIN1\textendash green fluorescent protein (GFP) appeared to be unaffected in the fwr roots but the levels of endogenous IAA were actually higher in the fwr roots than in the wild type. These results indicate that LR initiation is one of the most sensitive processes among GNOM-dependent developmental processes, strongly suggesting that GNOM is required for the establishment of the auxin response maximum for LR initiation, probably through the regulation of local and global auxin distribution in the root.},

But not all CTCF sites genome-wide function as insulator elements, depending on cellular and genomic context. To dissect the influence of genomic context on enhancer blocker activity, we integrated reporter constructs with promoter-only, promoter and enhancer, and enhancer blocker configurations at hundreds of thousands of genomic sites using the Sleeping Beauty transposase. Deconvolution of reporter activity by genomic position reveals distinct expression patterns subject to genomic context, including a compartment of enhancer blocker reporter integrations with robust expression. The high density of integration sites permits quantitative delineation of characteristic genomic context sensitivity profiles and their decomposition into sensitivity to both local and distant DNase I hypersensitive sites. Furthermore, using a single-cell expression approach to test the effect of integrated reporters for differential expression of nearby endogenous genes reveals that CTCF insulator elements do not completely abrogate reporter effects on endogenous gene expression. Collectively, our results lend new insight into genomic regulatory compartmentalization and its influence on the determinants of promoter\textendash enhancer specificity.},

  abstract = {This overview discusses issues involved with creating and manipulating vectors for expression of fusion proteins. The requirements for efficient translation include a promoter and a start codon, along with the fact that the mRNA encoding the protein to be expressed must contain a ribosome-binding site that is not blocked by mRNA secondary structure. The level of expression is also affected by codon preferences, and may be affected by the coding sequence in other ways that are not yet well understood. In virtually all cases, these problems can be solved by altering the sequence preceding the start codon, and/or by making changes in the 5{${'}$} end of the coding sequence that do not change the protein sequence, taking advantage of the degeneracy of the genetic code. However, it is often quicker to solve these problems by making fusions between genes. In this approach the cloned gene is introduced into an expression vector 3{${'}$} to a sequence (carrier sequence) coding for the amino terminus of a highly expressed protein (carrier protein). The carrier sequence provides the necessary signals for good expression, and the expressed fusion protein contains an N-terminal region encoded by the carrier. The carrier sequence can also code for an entire functional moiety or even for an entire protein that can be exploited in purifying the protein, either with antibodies or with an affinity purification specific for that carrier protein. Alternatively unique physical properties of the carrier protein (e.g., heat stability) can be exploited to allow selective purification of the fusion protein. Often, proteins fused to these carriers can be separated from the bulk of intracellular contaminants by taking advantage of special attributes.},

The discovery of extensive transcription of large RNA transcripts that do not code for proteins, termed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), provides an important new perspective on the centrality of RNA in gene regulation. Here, we discuss genome-scale strategies to discover and characterize lncRNAs. An emerging theme from multiple model systems is that lncRNAs form extensive networks of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes with numerous chromatin regulators and then target these enzymatic activities to appropriate locations in the genome. Consistent with this notion, lncRNAs can function as modular scaffolds to specify higher-order organization in RNP complexes and in chromatin states. The importance of these modes of regulation is underscored by the newly recognized roles of long RNAs for proper gene control across all kingdoms of life.},

  abstract = {In vertebrates, the engrailed genes are expressed at early neurula stage in a narrow stripe encompassing the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB), a region from which a peculiar structure, the isthmus, is formed. Knock-out experiments in mice demonstrated that these genes are essential for the development of this structure and of its derivatives. In contrast, little is known about the effect of an overexpression of engrailed genes in vertebrate development. Here we report the isolation of Ol-eng2, a medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) engrailed gene. We have monitored the effects of its widespread expression following mRNA injections in 1- and 2-cell medaka and Xenopus embryos. We found that the ectopic expression of Ol-eng2 predominantly results in an altered development of the anterior brain, including an inhibition of optic vesicle formation. No change in the patterns of mesencephalic and telencephalic markers were observed. In contrast, expressions of markers of the diencephalon were strongly repressed in injected embryos. Furthermore, the endogenous Ol-eng2, Pax2, Wnt1 and Fgf8, which are essential components of the MHB genetic cascade, were ectopically expressed in this region. Therefore, we propose that Ol-eng2 induces de novo formation of an isthmus-like structure, which correlates with the development of ectopic midbrain structures, including optic tectum. A competence of the diencephalon to change to a midbrain fate has been demonstrated in isthmic graft experiments. Our data demonstrate that this change can be mimicked by ectopic engrailed expression alone.},

Here we address transcriptional parameters underlying this cohesin-dependence by single-molecule RNA-FISH and single-cell RNA-sequencing. We show that inducible innate immune genes are regulated predominantly by an increase in the probability of active transcription, and that probabilities of enhancer and promoter transcription are coordinated. Cohesin has no major impact on the fraction of transcribed inducible enhancers, or the number of mature mRNAs produced per transcribing cell. Cohesin is, however, required for coupling the probabilities of enhancer and promoter transcription. Enhancer-promoter coupling may not be explained by spatial proximity alone, and at the model locus Il12b can be disrupted by selective inhibition of the cohesinopathy-associated BET bromodomain BD2. Our data identify discrete steps in enhancer-mediated inducible gene expression that differ in cohesin-dependence, and suggest that cohesin and BD2 may act on shared pathways.},

Being a substrate of the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex-Cdh1 (APCCdh1), PFKFB3 is targeted to proteasomal degradation in neurons. Here, we show that activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors (NMDAR) stabilized PFKFB3 protein in cortical neurons. Expressed PFKFB3 was found to be mainly localized in the nucleus, where it is subjected to degradation; however, expression of PFKFB3 lacking the APCCdh1-targeting KEN motif, or following NMDAR stimulation, promoted accumulation of PFKFB3 and its release from the nucleus to the cytosol through an excess Cdh1-inhibitable process. NMDAR-mediated increase in PFKFB3 yielded neurons having a higher glycolysis and lower pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP); this led to oxidative stress and apoptotic neuronal death that was counteracted by overexpressing glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP. Furthermore, expression of the mutant form of PFKFB3 lacking the KEN motif was sufficient to trigger oxidative stress and apoptotic death of neurons. These results reveal that, by inhibition of APCCdh1, glutamate receptors activation stabilizes PFKFB3 thus switching neuronal metabolism leading to oxidative damage and neurodegeneration.},

Although TFF1 is highly induced, we observe short active periods and variable inactive periods ranging from minutes to days. The heterogeneity in inactive times gives rise to the widely observed ``noise'' in human gene expression and explains the distribution of protein levels in human tissue.

To introduce timestamps, we tag RNA with a reporter motif consisting of multiple MS2 binding sites that recruit the adenosine deaminase ADAR2 fused to an MS2 capsid protein. ADAR2 binding to tagged RNA causes A-to-I edits to accumulate over time, allowing the age of the RNA to be inferred with hour-scale accuracy. By combining observations of multiple timestamped RNAs driven by the same promoter, we can determine when the promoter was active. We demonstrate that the system can infer the presence and timing of multiple past transcriptional events. Finally, we apply the method to cluster single cells according to the timing of past transcriptional activity. RNA timestamps will allow the incorporation of temporal information into RNA-seq workflows.},

We report that a genome-wide B1 SINE (Short Interspersed Nuclear Element) retrotransposon (B1-X35S) has potent intrinsic insulator activity in cultured cells and live animals. This insulation is mediated by binding of the transcription factors dioxin receptor (AHR) and SLUG (SNAI2) to consensus elements present in the SINE. Transcription of B1-X35S is required for insulation. While basal insulator activity is maintained by RNA polymerase (Pol) III transcription, AHR-induced insulation involves release of Pol III and engagement of Pol II transcription on the same strand. B1-X35S insulation is also associated with enrichment of heterochromatin marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 downstream of B1-X35S, an effect that varies with cell type. B1-X35S binds parylated CTCF and, consistent with a chromatin barrier activity, its positioning between two adjacent genes correlates with their differential expression in mouse tissues. Hence, B1 SINE retrotransposons represent genome-wide insulators activated by transcription factors that respond to developmental, oncogenic, or toxicological stimuli.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Although cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene and protein expression within cell populations has been widely documented, we know little about its potential biological functions. We addressed this issue by studying progenitors that populate the posterior region of the vertebrate embryos, a cell population known for its capacity to self-renew or to contribute to the formation of the neural tube and the paraxial mesoderm. Posterior progenitors are characterized by the co-expression of Sox2 and Brachyury (Bra), two transcription factors related to neural and mesodermal lineages, respectively. In this study, we show that the respective levels of Sox2 and Bra proteins display a high degree of variability among posterior progenitors of the quail embryo. By developing forced expression and downregulation approaches, we further provide evidence that the value of the Sox2-to-Bra ratio in a given progenitor directs its choice of staying in place or exit the progenitor zone to generate neural or mesodermal cells. Time-lapse imaging together with mathematical modeling then reveal that variations of the Sox2-to-Bra ratio confer these cells heterogeneous motile behaviors. While high Bra levels display high motile properties that push cells to join the mesoderm, high levels of Sox2 tend to inhibit cell movement making cells get integrated into the neural tube. Our work thus provides evidence that the spatial heterogeneity of posterior progenitors, with regards to their relative contents of Sox2 and Bra and thus to their motile properties, is fundamental to maintain a pool of resident progenitors while others segregate to contribute to tissue formation.

  abstract = {Variability of gene expression due to stochasticity of transcription or variation of extrinsic signals, termed biological noise, is a potential driving force of cellular differentiation. While unicellular organisms exploit noise as a bet-hedging strategy, its role during multilineage differentiation of stem cells is underexplored. Utilizing single-cell RNA-sequencing to reconstruct cell state manifolds, we developed VarID2, a method for the quantification of biological noise at single-cell resolution. VarID2 reveals enhanced nuclear versus cytoplasmic noise across cell types of the peripheral blood, and distinct regulatory modes stratified by correlation between noise, expression, and chromatin accessibility. Noise levels are minimal in murine hematopoietic stem cells and increase during both differentiation and ageing. Differential noise identified myeloid-biased Dlk1+ long-term-HSCs in aged mice with enhanced quiescence and self-renewal capacity. VarID2 reveals fundamental properties of noise across cellular compartments, during stem cell differentiation and ageing, and uncovers distinct cellular sub-states invisible to conventional gene expression analysis.},

  abstract = {Mutations in the suppressor of Hairy-wing [su(Hw)] locus reverse the phenotype of a number of tissue-specific mutations caused by insertion of a gypsy retrotransposon. The su(Hw) gene encodes a zinc finger protein which binds to a 430 bp region of gypsy shown to be both necessary and sufficient for its mutagenic effects. su(Hw) protein causes mutations by inactivation of enhancer elements only when a su(Hw) binding region is located between these regulatory sequences and a promoter. To understand the molecular basis of enhancer inactivation, we tested the effects of su(Hw) protein on expression of the mini-white gene. We find that su(Hw) protein stabilizes mini-white gene expression from chromosomal position-effects in euchromatic locations by inactivating negative and positive regulatory elements present in flanking DNA. Furthermore, the su(Hw) protein partially protects transposon insertions from the negative effects of heterochromatin. To explain our current results, we propose that su(Hw) protein alters the organization of chromatin by creating a new boundary in a pre-existing domain of higher order chromatin structure. This separates enhancers and silencers distal to the su(Hw) binding region into an independent unit of gene activity, thereby causing their inactivation.},

Histological examination of skeletal muscle failed to reveal any morphological abnormalities in these mice. Furthermore, Northern analysis revealed normal levels of skeletal muscle-specific mRNAs. Significantly, Myf-5 mRNA levels are elevated in postnatal mutant mice. Normally, Myf-5 expression becomes markedly reduced at day 12 of gestation when MyoD mRNA first appears. This suggests that Myf-5 expression is repressed by MyoD. Our results indicate that MyoD is dispensable for skeletal muscle development in mice, revealing some degree of functional redundancy in the control of the skeletal myogenic developmental program.},

In erythroid cells a clear transition in DNase I sensitivity of chromatin at the 3? end of the locus is observed, the location of this transition is marked by a constitutive DNase I hypersensitive site (HS), and DNA spanning this site has the enhancer-blocking capacity of an insulator. This HS contains a binding site for the transcription factor CTCF. As in the case of the 5? insulator, the CTCF site is both necessary and sufficient for the enhancer-blocking activity of the 3? boundary. The position of this insulator is consistent with our proposal that it may function to maintain the distinct regulatory programs of the globin genes and their closely appended 3? neighbor, an odorant receptor gene. We conclude that both boundaries of the chicken ?-globin domain are capable of playing functionally similar roles and that the same protein is a necessary component of the molecular mechanism through which these boundaries are defined.},

ASK1 induction initiates a signalling cascade leading to apoptosis. After exposure of cells to H2O2, ASK1 is transiently activated by autophosphorylation at Thr845. The protein then associates with PP5 (protein serine/threonine phosphatase 5), which inactivates ASK1 by dephosphorylation of Thr845. Although this feedback regulation mechanism has been elucidated, it remains unclear how ASK1 is maintained in the dephosphorylated state under non-stressed conditions. In the present study, we have examined the possible role of PP2C{$\epsilon$} (protein phosphatase 2C{$\epsilon$}), a member of PP2C family, in the regulation of ASK1 signalling. Following expression in HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells), wild-type PP2C{$\epsilon$} inhibited ASK1-induced activation of an AP-1 (activator protein 1) reporter gene. Conversely, a dominant-negative PP2C{$\epsilon$} mutant enhanced AP-1 activity. Exogenous PP2C{$\epsilon$} associated with exogenous ASK1 in HEK-293 cells under non-stressed conditions, inactivating ASK1 by decreasing Thr845 phosphorylation. The association of endogenous PP2C{$\epsilon$} and ASK1 was also observed in mouse brain extracts. PP2C{$\epsilon$} directly dephosphorylated ASK1 at Thr845 in vitro. In contrast with PP5, PP2C{$\epsilon$} transiently dissociated from ASK1 within cells upon H2O2 treatment. These results suggest that PP2C{$\epsilon$} maintains ASK1 in an inactive state by dephosphorylation in quiescent cells, supporting the possibility that PP2C{$\epsilon$} and PP5 play different roles in H2O2-induced regulation of ASK1 activity.},

We show that PP2Cepsilon is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein with a transmembrane domain at the amino terminus and the catalytic domain facing the cytoplasm. Yeast two-hybrid screening of a human brain library using PP2Cepsilon as bait resulted in the isolation of a cDNA that encoded vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A (VAPA). VAPA is an ER resident integral membrane protein involved in recruiting lipid-binding proteins such as the ceramide transport protein CERT to the ER membrane. Expression of PP2Cepsilon resulted in dephosphorylation of CERT in a VAPA expression-dependent manner, which was accompanied by redistribution of CERT from the cytoplasm to the Golgi apparatus. The expression of PP2Cepsilon also enhanced the association between CERT and VAPA. In addition, knockdown of PP2Cepsilon expression by short interference RNA attenuated the interaction between CERT and VAPA and the sphingomyelin synthesis. These results suggest that CERT is a physiological substrate of PP2Cepsilon and that dephosphorylation of CERT by PP2Cepsilon may play an important role in the regulation of ceramide trafficking from the ER to the Golgi apparatus.},

Pericentromeres consist of repetitive tandem satellite repeats and are crucial chromosomal elements that are responsible for accurate chromosome segregation in mitosis. The repeat sequences are not conserved and can greatly vary between different organisms, suggesting that pericentromeric functions might be controlled epigenetically. In this review, we will discuss how constitutive heterochromatin is formed and maintained at pericentromeres in order to ensure their integrity. We will describe the biogenesis and the function of main epigenetic pathways that are involved and how they are interconnected. Interestingly, recent findings suggest that alternative pathways could substitute for well-established pathways when disrupted, suggesting that constitutive heterochromatin harbors much more plasticity than previously assumed. In addition, despite of the heterochromatic nature of pericentromeres, there is increasing evidence for active and regulated transcription at these loci, in a multitude of organisms and under various biological contexts. Thus, in the second part of this review, we will address this relatively new aspect and discuss putative functions of pericentromeric expression.},

Whether EMT generates CSCs de novo, enhances migration of existing CSCs or both is unclear. We examined patient tissue of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) along with carcinomas of breast, lung, kidney, prostate and ovary. For in vitro studies, five established PDA cell lines classified as less (CSClow) and highly aggressive CSC-like cells (CSChigh) were examined by single and double immunofluorescence microscopy, wound-, transwell-, and time-lapse microscopy. HIF-1{$\alpha$} and Slug, as well as HIF-2{$\alpha$} and CD133 were co-expressed pointing to a putative co-existence of hypoxia, EMT and CSCs in vivo. CSChigh cells exhibited high basal expression of the mesenchymal Vimentin protein but low or absent expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin, with the opposite result in CSClow cells. Hypoxia triggered altering of cell morphology from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype, which was more pronounced in CSChigh cells. Concomitantly, E-cadherin expression was reduced and expression of Vimentin, Slug, Twist2 and Zeb1 enhanced. While hypoxia caused migration in all cell lines, velocity along with the percentage of migrating, polarized and pseudopodia-forming cells was significantly higher in CSChigh cells.

Here, we analyzed the transcriptional response of human MCF-7 cells to retinoic acid and TGF-{$\beta$}, applied individually and in combination. The combined transcriptional responses of induced genes exhibited a range of behaviors, but clearly favored both additive and multiplicative outcomes. We performed paired chromatin accessibility measurements and found that increases in accessibility were largely additive. There was some association between super-additivity of accessibility and multiplicative or super-multiplicative combined transcriptional responses, while sub-additivity of accessibility associated with additive transcriptional responses. Our findings suggest that mechanistic models of combined transcriptional regulation must be able to reproduce a range of behaviors.},

Although studies in Drosophila melanogaster have revealed phenotypic associations between chromatin-modifying enzymes and their histone substrates, comparable studies in mammalian models do not exist3\textendash 5. Here, we use CRISPR base editing in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to address the regulatory role of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27), a substrate for Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated methylation and CBP/EP300-mediated acetylation6,7. By generating pan-H3K27R (pK27R) mutant mESCs, where all 28 alleles of H3.1, H3.2 and H3.3 have been mutated, we demonstrate similarity in transcription patterns of genes and differentiation to PRC2-null mutants. Moreover, H3K27 acetylation is not essential for gene derepression linked to loss of H3K27 methylation, or de novo activation of genes during cell-fate transition to epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs). In conclusion, our results show that H3K27 is an essential substrate for PRC2 in mESCs, whereas other PTMs in addition to H3K27 acetylation are likely involved in mediating CBP/EP300 function. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of large-scale multicopy gene editing to interrogate histone PTM function in mammalian cells.},

In contrast, mammalian cells are thought to require the sequential activation of at least four different cyclin-dependent kinases, Cdk2, Cdk3, Cdk4 and Cdk6, to drive cells through interphase, as well as Cdk1 to proceed through mitosis. This model has been challenged by recent genetic evidence that mice survive in the absence of individual interphase Cdks. Moreover, most mouse cell types proliferate in the absence of two or even three interphase Cdks. Similar results have been obtained on ablation of some of the activating subunits of Cdks, such as the D-type and E-type cyclins. Here we show that mouse embryos lacking all interphase Cdks (Cdk2, Cdk3, Cdk4 and Cdk6) undergo organogenesis and develop to midgestation. In these embryos, Cdk1 binds to all cyclins, resulting in the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein pRb and the expression of genes that are regulated by E2F transcription factors. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from these embryos proliferate in vitro, albeit with an extended cell cycle due to inefficient inactivation of Rb proteins. However, they become immortal on continuous passage. We also report that embryos fail to develop to the morula and blastocyst stages in the absence of Cdk1. These results indicate that Cdk1 is the only essential cell cycle Cdk. Moreover, they show that in the absence of interphase Cdks, Cdk1 can execute all the events that are required to drive cell division.},

Sarropoulos et al. analyzed mouse cerebellar development in the context of gene-regulatory networks. Single nuclear profiles analyzing chromatin accessibility in about 90,000 cells revealed diversity in progenitor cells and genetic programs guiding cellular differentiation. The footsteps of evolution were apparent in varying constraints on different cell types. Science, abg4696, this issue p. eabg4696 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONThe cerebellum contributes to many complex brain functions, including motor control, language, and memory. During development, distinct neural cells are generated at cerebellar germinal zones in a spatiotemporally restricted manner. Cis-regulatory elements (CREs), such as enhancers and promoters, and the transcription factors that bind to them are central to cell fate specification and differentiation. Although most CREs undergo rapid turnover during evolution, a few are conserved across vertebrates. RATIONALEBulk measurements of CRE activity have provided insights into gene regulation in the cerebellum, as well as into the evolutionary dynamics of CREs during organ development. However, they lack the cellular resolution required to assess cell-type differences in regulatory constraint and unravel the regulatory programs associated with the specification and differentiation of cell types. RESULTSHere, we generated a single-cell atlas of gene regulation in the mouse cerebellum spanning 11 developmental stages, from the beginning of neurogenesis to adulthood. By acquiring snATAC-seq (single-nucleus assay for transposase accessible chromatin using sequencing) profiles for \textasciitilde 90,000 cells, we mapped all major cerebellar cell types and identified candidate CREs.Characterization of CRE activity across the cerebellum development highlights the cell- and time-specificity of gene regulation. Many of the differentially accessible CREs are specific to a single cell type and state, but we also identified a fraction of CREs with pleiotropic (shared) activity. At early developmental stages, temporal changes in CRE activity are shared between progenitor cells from different germinal zones, supporting a model of cell fate induction through common temporal cues. Pleiotropic CREs in major cerebellar neuron types (granule cells, Purkinje cells, and inhibitory interneurons) are more active at early differentiation states, and the regulatory programs gradually diverge as differentiation proceeds.Based on comparisons to vertebrate genomes, we observed a decrease in CRE sequence conservation during development for all cerebellar cell types, a pattern that is largely explained by differentiation as well as by additional temporal differences between cells from matched differentiation states. Across cell types, differences in regulatory conservation are most pronounced in the adult, where microglia\textemdash the immune cells of the brain\textemdash show the fastest evolutionary turnover. By contrast, mature astrocytes harbor the most conserved intergenic CREs, not only in the cerebellum but also across a wide range of cell types in adult mouse organs.To evaluate the conservation of CRE activity, we acquired snATAC-seq profiles for \textasciitilde 20,000 cerebellar cells from the gray short-tailed opossum, a marsupial separated from mouse by \textasciitilde 160 million years of evolution. Our comparative analysis of CRE activity in the two therian species reinforced our sequence-based conclusions regarding differences in CRE constraint across cell types and developmental stages and also revealed that despite the overall high turnover of CREs, radical repurposing of spatiotemporal CRE activity is rare, at least between cell types in the same tissue. CONCLUSIONThis study reveals extensive temporal differences in CRE activity across cerebellar cell types and a shared decrease in CRE conservation during development and differentiation. Given that the cerebellum has been successfully used as a model system to study cell fate specification, neurogenesis, and other developmental processes, we expect that our observations regarding the developmental and evolutionary dynamics of regulatory elements, and their interplay, are also applicable to mammalian organs in general. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/373/6558/eabg4696/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Cis-regulatory elements in cerebellar cells.snATAC-seq delineates cell- and time-specific CRE activity in the developing mouse cerebellum (left).

  abstract = {Recent transcriptome analyses have shown that thousands of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are transcribed from mammalian genomes. Although the number of functionally annotated ncRNAs is still limited, they are known to be frequently retained in the nucleus, where they coordinate regulatory networks of gene expression. Some subnuclear organelles or nuclear bodies include RNA species whose identity and structural roles are largely unknown. We identified 2 abundant overlapping ncRNAs, MENepsilon and MENbeta (MENepsilon/beta), which are transcribed from the corresponding site in the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I locus and which localize to nuclear paraspeckles. This finding raises the intriguing possibility that MENepsilon/beta are involved in paraspeckle organization, because paraspeckles are, reportedly, RNase-sensitive structures. Successful removal of MENepsilon/beta by a refined knockdown method resulted in paraspeckle disintegration. Furthermore, the reassembly of paraspeckles disassembled by transcriptional arrest appeared to be unsuccessful in the absence of MENepsilon/beta. RNA interference and immunoprecipitation further revealed that the paraspeckle proteins p54/nrb and PSF selectively associate with and stabilize the longer MENbeta, thereby contributing to the organization of the paraspeckle structure. The paraspeckle protein PSP1 is not directly involved in either MENepsilon/beta stabilization or paraspeckle organization. We postulate a model for nuclear paraspeckle body organization where specific ncRNAs and RNA-binding proteins cooperate to maintain and, presumably, establish the structure.},

Although cyclin D functions appear largely tissue specific, we demonstrate that cyclin D3 has unique functions in lymphocyte development and cannot be replaced by cyclin D2, which is also expressed during blood differentiation. We show that only combined deletion of p27Kip1 and retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (Rb) is sufficient to rescue the development of Ccnd3-/- thymocytes. Furthermore, we show that a small molecule targeting the kinase function of cyclin D3:CDK4/6 inhibits both cell cycle entry in human T~cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and disease progression in animal models of T-ALL. These studies identify unique functions for cyclin D3:CDK4/6 complexes and suggest potential therapeutic protocols for this devastating blood tumor.},

  abstract = {Cells of the mammary gland are in intimate contact with other cells and with the extracellular matrix (ECM), both of which provide not only a biochemical context, but a mechanical context as well. Cell-mediated contraction allows cells to sense the stiffness of their microenvironment, and respond with appropriate mechanosignaling events that regulate gene expression and differentiation. ECM composition and organization are tightly regulated throughout development of the mammary gland, resulting in corresponding regulation of the mechanical environment and proper tissue architecture. Mechanical regulation is also at play during breast carcinoma progression, as changes in ECM deposition, composition, and organization accompany breast carcinoma. These changes result in stiffer matrices that activate mechanosignaling pathways and thereby induce cell proliferation, facilitate local tumor cell invasion, and promote progression. Thus, understanding the role of forces in the mammary gland is crucial to understanding both normal developmental and pathological processes.},

This homolog-pairing dependent process is facilitated in Drosophila by chromatin-associated pairing proteins, many of which remain unknown and their mechanism of action uncharacterized. Here we have tested the role of the gypsy chromatin insulator in facilitating pairing and communication between enhancers and promoters in trans using a transgenic eGFP reporter system engineered to allow for targeted deletions in the vestigial Boundary Enhancer (vgBE) and the hsp70 minimal promoter, along with one or two flanking gypsy elements. We found a modest 2.5-3x increase in eGFP reporter levels from homozygotes carrying an intact copy of the reporter on each homolog compared to unpaired hemizygotes, although this behavior was independent of gypsy. However, detectable levels of GFP protein along the DV wing boundary in trans-heterozygotes lacking a single enhancer and promoter was only observed in the presence of two flanking gypsy elements. Our results demonstrate that gypsy can stimulate enhancer-promoter communication in trans throughout the genome in a context-dependent manner, likely through modulation of local chromatin dynamics once pairing has been established by other elements and highlights chromatin structure as the master regulator of this phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Three general classes of yeast protein-coding genes are distinguished by their dependence on the transcription cofactors TFIID, SAGA and Mediator (MED) Tail, but little is known about whether this dependence is determined by the core promoter, Upstream activation sites (UASs), or other gene features. It is also unclear whether UASs can broadly activate transcription from the different promoter classes or whether efficient transcription requires matching UASs and promoters of similar gene class. Here we measure transcription and cofactor specificity for tens of thousands of UAS-core promoter combinations. We find that {$<$}5\% of UASs display strong core promoter specificity while most UASs can broadly activate promoters regardless of regulatory class. However, we find that matching UASs and promoters from the same gene class is generally important for optimal expression. From examining the cofactor dependence of this large UAS-promoter set, we find that sensitivity to rapid depletion of MED Tail or SAGA is dependent on the identity of both UAS and promoter while dependence on TFIID localizes to only the core promoter. Our results explain why transcription factor-mediated MED recruitment to the UAS does not always result in Tail-dependent transcription and highlight the role of TATA and TATA-like promoter sequences in MED Tail function.},

Following establishment of the primordia, each brain part is thought to develop largely independently from the others under the influence of local organizing centers like the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB, or isthmic) organizer. Mechanisms that maintain the integrity of brain subdivisions at later stages are not yet known. To examine such mechanisms in the anterior neural tube, we have studied the establishment and maintenance of the diencephalic-mesencephalic boundary (DMB). We show that maintenance of the DMB requires both the presence of a specified midbrain and a functional MHB organizer. Expression of pax6.1, a key regulator of forebrain development, is posteriorly suppressed by the Engrailed proteins, Eng2 and Eng3. Mis-expression of eng3 in the forebrain primordium causes downregulation of pax6.1, and forebrain cells correspondingly change their fate and acquire midbrain identity. Conversely, in embryos lacking both eng2 and eng3, the DMB shifts caudally into the midbrain territory. However, a patch of midbrain tissue remains between the forebrain and the hindbrain primordia in such embryos. This suggests that an additional factor maintains midbrain cell fate. We find that Fgf8 is a candidate for this signal, as it is both necessary and sufficient to repress pax6.1 and hence to shift the DMB anteriorly independently of the expression status of eng2/eng3. By examining small cell clones that are unable to receive an Fgf signal, we show that cells in the presumptive midbrain neural plate require an Fgf signal to keep them from following a forebrain fate. Combined loss of both Eng2/Eng3 and Fgf8 leads to complete loss of midbrain identity, resulting in fusion of the forebrain and the hindbrain primordia. Thus, Eng2/Eng3 and Fgf8 are necessary to maintain midbrain identity in the neural plate and thereby position the DMB.

The underlying molecular mechanisms are beginning to become unraveled and an overview of the current knowledge on BMI1 signaling in normal and leukemic stem cells will be presented here. RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to a role in bypassing senescence and the orchestration of the symmetry of hematopoietic stem cell divisions, it has recently become clear that BMI1 also functions in the protection against oxidative stress. In the absence of BMI1, reactive oxygen species accumulate, associating with activation of DNA damage response pathways and increased apoptosis. BMI1-mediated control over reactive oxygen species levels might occur independently of the INK4a/ARF pathway, but rather involves impaired mitochondrial functions. In human hematopoietic malignancies, BMI1 is frequently overexpressed, which associates with poor prognosis. Down modulation of BMI1 impairs self-renewal and long-term expansion of leukemic stem cells. SUMMARY: Understanding molecular mechanisms by which BMI1 affects stem cell fate will increase our insights into the biology of hematopoietic stem cells and will also aid in understanding the process of leukemic transformation and ultimately in the identification of drugable targets that might facilitate the eradication of leukemic stem cells.},

  abstract = {Chromatin insulator elements and associated proteins have been proposed to partition eukaryotic genomes into sets of independently regulated domains. Here we test this hypothesis by quantitative genome-wide analysis of insulator protein binding to Drosophila chromatin. We find distinct combinatorial binding of insulator proteins to different classes of sites and uncover a novel type of insulator element that binds CP190 but not any other known insulator proteins. Functional characterization of different classes of binding sites indicates that only a small fraction act as robust insulators in standard enhancer-blocking assays. We show that insulators restrict the spreading of the H3K27me3 mark but only at a small number of Polycomb target regions and only to prevent repressive histone methylation within adjacent genes that are already transcriptionally inactive. RNAi knockdown of insulator proteins in cultured cells does not lead to major alterations in genome expression. Taken together, these observations argue against the concept of a genome partitioned by specialized boundary elements and suggest that insulators are reserved for specific regulation of selected genes.},

  abstract = {Imaging and chromosome conformation capture studies have revealed several layers of chromosome organization, including segregation into megabase-sized active and inactive compartments, and partitioning into sub-megabase domains (TADs). It remains unclear, however, how these layers of organization form, interact with one another and influence genome function. Here we show that deletion of the cohesin-loading factor Nipbl in mouse liver leads to a marked reorganization of chromosomal folding. TADs and associated Hi-C peaks vanish globally, even in the absence of transcriptional changes. By contrast, compartmental segregation is preserved and even reinforced. Strikingly, the disappearance of TADs unmasks a finer compartment structure that accurately reflects the underlying epigenetic landscape. These observations demonstrate that the three-dimensional organization of the genome results from the interplay of two independent mechanisms: cohesin-independent segregation of the genome into fine-scale compartments, defined by chromatin state; and cohesin-dependent formation of TADs, possibly by loop extrusion, which helps to guide distant enhancers to their target genes.},

In the context of cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, the forces that are generated within the actin cytoskeleton and transmitted through integrin-based focal adhesions are essential for the cellular response to environmental clues, such as the spatial distribution of adhesive ligands or matrix stiffness. Whereas substantial progress has been made in identifying mechanosensitive molecules that can transduce mechanical force into biochemical signals, much less is known about the nature of cytoskeletal force generation and transmission that regulates the magnitude, duration and spatial distribution of forces imposed on these mechanosensitive complexes. By focusing on cell-matrix adhesion to flat elastic substrates, on which traction forces can be measured with high temporal and spatial resolution, we discuss our current understanding of the physical mechanisms that integrate a large range of molecular mechanotransduction events on cellular scales. Physical limits of stability emerge as one important element of the cellular response that complements the structural changes affected by regulatory systems in response to mechanical processes.},

In the present study, we have produced a polyclonal antibody against the purified human p63 protein to reassess the subcellular distribution of p63 by confocal immunofluorescence, immunoelectron microscopy, and cell fractionation. Double immunofluorescence of COS cells showed significant colocalization of p63 and a KDEL-containing lumenal ER marker protein, except for differences in the staining of the outer nuclear membrane. Immunoelectron microscopy of native HepG2 cells and of COS cells transfected with p63 revealed that both endogenous and overexpressed p63 are predominantly localized in the rough ER. While p63 was colocalized with protein disulfide isomerase, an ER marker protein, very little overlap of p63 was found with ERGIC-53, an established marker for the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment. When rough and smooth membranes were prepared from rat liver, p63 was found to copurify with ribophorin II, a rough ER protein. Both p63 and ribophorin II were predominantly recovered in rough microsomes and were largely separated from the intermediate compartment marker protein p58. From these results it is concluded that p63 is localized in the rough ER.},

The Drosophila gypsy retrotransposon contains an insulator composed of 12 degenerate binding sites for the Suppressor of Hairy-wing [Su(Hw)] protein that are separated by AT-rich DNA possessing sequence motifs common to matrix/scaffold attachment regions (MARs/SARs). To further understand mechanisms of insulator function, the parameters required for the gypsy insulator to prevent enhancer-activated transcription were examined. Synthetic binding regions were created by reiteration of a single Su(Hw) binding site that lacked the MAR/SAR motifs. These synthetic binding regions reconstituted insulator activity, suggesting that the property of enhancer blocking may be distinct from matrix association. We found that the number and spacing of Su(Hw) binding sites within the gypsy insulator, as well as the strength of the enhancer to be blocked, were important determinants of insulator function. These results provide a link between transcription and insulation, suggesting that these processes may be mechanistically interconnected.},

By using synthetic TFs with TALE DNA-binding domains, we systematically altered different aspects of these bursts. Specifically, we linked the polymerase initiation frequency to the strength of the transactivation domain and the burst duration to the TF lifetime on the promoter. Our results show how TFs and promoter binding domains collectively act to regulate different bursting parameters, offering a vast, evolutionarily tunable regulatory range for individual genes.},

Here, we review recent insights into the functions of non-coding regulatory elements and their protein interactors during transcription control. A picture emerges in which the topological environment constraints enhancer-promoter interactions and specific enhancer-bound proteins with distinct promoter-compatibilities refine target promoter choice. Such compatibilities are encoded within the sequences of enhancers and promoters and realized by diverse transcription factors and cofactors with distinct biochemical activities. An emerging property of transcription factors and cofactors is the formation of nuclear microenvironments or membraneless compartments that can have properties of phase-separated liquids. These environments are able to selectively enrich certain proteins and small molecules over others. Further investigation into the interaction of transcriptional regulators with themselves and regulatory DNA elements will help reveal the complexities of gene regulation within the context of the nucleus.},

Global modeling of contact density and clustering of domains show that inactive domains are condensed and confined to their chromosomal territories, whereas active domains reach out of the territory to form remote intra- and interchromosomal contacts. Moreover, we systematically identify specific long-range intrachromosomal contacts between Polycomb-repressed domains.

This nascent transcriptome-profiling method can identify different cell types and states with mouse embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts. The nascent sites of RNA synthesis tend to be localized on the surfaces of chromosome territories, and their organization in individual cells is highly variable. Surprisingly, the global nascent transcription oscillated asynchronously in individual cells with a period of 2~hr in mouse embryonic stem cells, as well as in fibroblasts. Together, spatial genomics of the nascent transcriptome by intron seqFISH reveals nuclear organizational principles and fast dynamics in single cells that are otherwise obscured.},

The kinetics by which RBPs bind to and dissociate from their RNA sites are critical for the coordination of cellular RNA\textendash protein interactions2. However, these kinetic parameters have not been experimentally measured in cells. Here we show that time-resolved RNA\textendash protein cross-linking with a pulsed femtosecond ultraviolet laser, followed by immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing, allows the determination of binding and dissociation kinetics of the RBP DAZL for thousands of individual RNA-binding sites in cells. This kinetic cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (KIN-CLIP) approach reveals that DAZL resides at individual binding sites for time periods of only seconds or shorter, whereas the binding sites remain DAZL-free for markedly longer. The data also indicate that DAZL binds to many RNAs in clusters of multiple proximal sites. The effect of DAZL on mRNA levels and ribosome association correlates with the cumulative probability of DAZL binding in these clusters. Integrating kinetic data with mRNA features quantitatively connects DAZL\textendash RNA binding to DAZL function. Our results show how kinetic parameters for RNA\textendash protein interactions can be measured in cells, and how these data link RBP\textendash RNA binding to the cellular function of RBPs. Time-resolved RNA\textendash protein cross-linking with a pulsed femtosecond ultraviolet laser, followed by immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing, enables the determination of binding and dissociation kinetics of the RNA-binding protein DAZL within cells.},

In analysis of the Hoxb4-Hoxb6 region of the HoxB complex we identified enhancers which lie in the intergenic region between Hoxb4 and Hoxb5, and which are capable of mediating the correct boundaries of neural and mesodermal expression for Hoxb5. We examined their regulatory properties in the context of the local genomic region spanning the two genes by transgenic analysis, in which each promoter was independently marked with a different reporter, to monitor simultaneously the relative transcriptional read-outs from each gene. Our analysis revealed that within this intergenic region: (i) a limb and a neural enhancer selectively activate Hoxb4 as opposed to Hoxb5; (ii) a separate neural enhancer is able to activate both genes, but expression is dependent upon competition between the two promoters for the enhancer and is influenced by the local genomic context; (iii) mesodermal enhancer activities can be shared between the genes. We found similar types of regulatory interactions between Hoxb5 and Hoxb6. Together these results provide evidence for three separate general mechanisms: selectivity, competition and sharing, that control the balance of cis-regulatory interactions necessary for generating the proper spatial and temporal patterns of Hox gene expression. We suggest that these mechanisms are part of a regulatory basis for maintenance of Hox organisation.},

Eight of 11 lines injected ip formed tumors within 3 months at variable rates with the following histological subtype distribution: one endometrioid, one serous, one clear cell, and five undifferentiated. Only mice injected with A2780-cp cells presented with ovarian-specific metastases (11 of 88), and the survival time of these animals was significantly shorter, which may be attributed to the higher proliferation rate as determined by Ki67 positivity. Additional analysis of the influence of the ovarian microenvironment on cell characteristics was conducted with ib injection of two cell lines (OVCA 429 and ES-2). The site of injection did not affect the tumor histology, the effect on proliferation was cell-type dependent, and the tumor take rate (cell survival) was negatively affected for OVCA 429 cells. The animal models described herein represent histologically distinct models of both early and late stage ovarian cancer useful for evaluation of therapeutics.},

  abstract = {CDK inhibitors are thought to prevent cell proliferation by negatively regulating cyclin-CDK complexes. We propose that the opposite is also true, that cyclin-CDK complexes in mammmalian cells can promote cell cycle progression by directly down-regulating CDK inhibitors. We show that expression of cyclin E-CDK2 in murine fibroblasts causes phosphorylation of the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 on T187, and that cyclin E-CDK2 can directly phosphorylate p27 T187 in vitro. We further show that cyclin E-CDK2-dependent phosphorylation of p27 results in elimination of p27 from the cell, allowing cells to transit from G1 to S phase. Moreover, mutation of T187 in p27 to alanine creates a p27 protein that causes a G1 block resistant to cyclin E and whose level of expression is not modulated by cyclin E. A kinetic analysis of the interaction between p27 and cyclin E-CDK2 explains how p27 can be regulated by the same enzyme it targets for inhibition. We show that p27 interacts with cyclin E-CDK2 in at least two distinct ways: one resulting in p27 phosphorylation and release, the other in tight binding and cyclin E-CDK2 inhibition. The binding of ATP to the CDK governs which state predominates. At low ATP ({$<$} 50 microM) p27 is primarily a CDK inhibitor, but at ATP concentrations approaching physiological levels ({$>$} 1 mM) p27 is more likely to be a substrate. Thus, we have identified p27 as a biologically relevant cyclin E-CDK2 substrate, demonstrated the physiological consequences of p27 phosphorylation, and developed a kinetic model to explain how p27 can be both an inhibitor and a substrate of cyclin E-CDK2.},

  abstract = {Bipolar disorder is a highly heritable mental illness, but the relevant genetic variants and molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Recent GWASs have identified an intergenic region associated with both cognitive performance and bipolar disorder. This region contains dozens of putative fetal brain-specific enhancers and is located {$\sim$}0.7 Mb upstream of the neuronal transcription factor POU3F2. We identified a candidate causal variant, rs77910749, that falls within a highly conserved putative enhancer, LC1. This human-specific variant is a single-base deletion in a PAX6 binding site and is predicted to be functional. We hypothesized that rs77910749 alters LC1 activity and hence POU3F2 expression during neurodevelopment. Indeed, transgenic reporter mice demonstrated LC1 activity in the developing cerebral cortex and amygdala. Furthermore, ex vivo reporter assays in embryonic mouse brain and human iPSC-derived cerebral organoids revealed increased enhancer activity conferred by the variant. To probe the in vivo function of LC1, we deleted the orthologous mouse region, which resulted in amygdala-specific changes in Pou3f2 expression. Lastly, `humanized' rs77910749 knock-in mice displayed behavioral defects in sensory gating, an amygdala-dependent endophenotype seen in patients with bipolar disorder. Our study suggests a molecular mechanism underlying the long-speculated link between enhanced cognitive performance and neuropsychiatric disease.},

  abstract = {Cis-regulatory elements (CREs, e.g., promoters and enhancers) regulate gene expression, and variants within CREs can modulate disease risk. Next-generation sequencing has enabled the rapid generation of genomic data that predict the locations of CREs, but a bottleneck lies in functionally interpreting these data. To address this issue, massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) have emerged, in which barcoded reporter libraries are introduced into cells, and the resulting barcoded transcripts are quantified by next-generation sequencing. Thus far, MPRAs have been largely restricted to assaying short CREs in a limited repertoire of cultured cell types. Here, we present two advances that extend the biological relevance and applicability of MPRAs. First, we adapt exome capture technology to instead capture candidate CREs, thereby tiling across the targeted regions and markedly increasing the length of CREs that can be readily assayed. Second, we package the library into adeno-associated virus (AAV), thereby allowing delivery to target organs in vivo. As a proof of concept, we introduce a capture library of about 46,000 constructs, corresponding to roughly 3500 DNase I hypersensitive (DHS) sites, into the mouse retina by ex vivo plasmid electroporation and into the mouse cerebral cortex by in vivo AAV injection. We demonstrate tissue-specific cis-regulatory activity of DHSs and provide examples of high-resolution truncation mutation analysis for multiplex parsing of CREs. Our approach should enable massively parallel functional analysis of a wide range of CREs in any organ or species that can be infected by AAV, such as nonhuman primates and human stem cell\textendash derived organoids.},

We find that several types of coding and noncoding RNAs are sufficient to de novo assemble, and are physiologically enriched in, histone locus bodies (with associated Cajal bodies), nuclear speckles, paraspeckles and nuclear stress bodies. Formation of nuclear bodies occurs through recruitment and accumulation of proteins resident in the nuclear bodies by nucleating RNA. These results demonstrate that transcription is a driving force in nuclear body formation and RNA transcripts can function as a scaffold in the formation of major nuclear bodies. Together, these data suggest that RNA-primed biogenesis of nuclear bodies is a general principle of nuclear organization.},

Here, we employed an in situ sequencing technique, STARmap PLUS3, 4, to map more than one million high-quality cells across the whole adult mouse brain and the spinal cord, profiling 1,022 genes at subcellular resolution with a voxel size of 194 X 194 X 345 nm in 3D. We developed computational pipelines to segment, cluster, and annotate 231 molecularly defined cell types and 64 tissue regions with single-cell resolution. To create a transcriptome-wide spatial atlas, we further integrated the STARmap PLUS measurements with a published scRNA-seq atlas1, imputing 11,844 genes at the single-cell level. Finally, we engineered a highly expressed RNA barcoding system to delineate the tropism of a brain-wide transgene delivery tool, AAV-PHP.eB5, 6, revealing its single-cell resolved transduction efficiency across the molecular cell types and tissue regions of the whole mouse brain. Together, our datasets and annotations provide a comprehensive, high-resolution single-cell resource that integrates a spatial molecular atlas, cell taxonomy, brain anatomy, and genetic manipulation accessibility of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS).},

We show that DNA sequences encoding TF binding site number, density, and affinity above sharply defined thresholds drive condensation of TFs and coactivators. A combination of specific structured (TF-DNA) and weak multivalent (TF-coactivator) interactions allows for condensates to form at particular genomic loci determined by the DNA sequence and the complement of expressed TFs. DNA features found to drive condensation promote enhancer activity and transcription in cells. Our study provides a framework to understand how the genome can scaffold transcriptional condensates at specific loci and how the universal phenomenon of phase separation might regulate this process.},

A total of 1,660,290 new cancer cases and 580,350 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States in 2013. During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2005-2009), delay-adjusted cancer incidence rates declined slightly in men (by 0.6\% per year) and were stable in women, while cancer death rates decreased by 1.8\% per year in men and by 1.5\% per year in women. Overall, cancer death rates have declined 20\% from their peak in 1991 (215.1 per 100,000 population) to 2009 (173.1 per 100,000 population). Death rates continue to decline for all 4 major cancer sites (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate). Over the past 10 years of data (2000-2009), the largest annual declines in death rates were for chronic myeloid leukemia (8.4\%), cancers of the stomach (3.1\%) and colorectum (3.0\%), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3.0\%). The reduction in overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of approximately 1.18 million deaths from cancer, with 152,900 of these deaths averted in 2009 alone.

This included designing better methods for the successful delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) into mammalian cells. While the simplest method for RNAi is the cytosolic delivery of siRNA oligonucleotides, this technique is limited to cells capable of transfection and is primarily utilized during transient in vitro studies. The introduction of shRNA into mammalian cells through infection with viral vectors allows for stable integration of shRNA and long-term knockdown of the targeted gene; however, several challenges exist with the implementation of this technology. Here we describe some well-tested protocols which should increase the chances of successful design, delivery, and assessment of gene knockdown by shRNA. We provide suggestions for designing shRNA targets and controls, a protocol for sequencing through the secondary structure of the shRNA hairpin structure, and protocols for packaging and delivery of shRNA lentiviral particles. Using real-time PCR and functional assays we demonstrate the successful knockdown of ASC, an inflammatory adaptor molecule. These studies demonstrate the practicality of including two shRNAs with different efficacies of knockdown to provide an additional level of control and to verify dose dependency of functional effects. Along with the methods described here, as new techniques and algorithms are designed in the future, shRNA is likely to include further promising application and continue to be a critical component of gene discovery.},

The septum that divides the cylindrical cell into two siblings is formed midway between the growing poles and perpendicularly to the axis that connects them. Since the daughter cells also extend at their ends and form their septa at right angles to the longitudinal axis, their septal (division) planes lie parallel to those of the mother cell. To gain a better understanding of how this regularity is ensured, we investigated septation in spherical cells that do not inherit morphologically predetermined cell ends to establish poles for growth. We studied four mutants (defining four novel genes), over 95\% of whose cells displayed a completely spherical morphology and a deficiency in mating and showed a random distribution of cytoplasmic microtubules, Tea1p, and F-actin, indicating that the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton was poorly polarized or apolar. Septum positioning was examined by visualizing septa and division scars by calcofluor staining and by the analysis of electron microscopic images. Freeze-substitution, freeze-etching, and scanning electron microscopy were used. We found that the elongated bipolar shape is not essential for the determination of a division plane that can separate the postmitotic nuclei. However, it seems to be necessary for the maintenance of the parallel orientation of septa over the generations. In the spherical cells, the division scars and septa usually lie at angles to each other on the cell surface. We hypothesize that the shape of the cell indirectly affects the positioning of the septum by directing the extension of the spindle.},

  abstract = {Mammalian gene expression patterns, and their variability across populations of cells, are regulated by factors specific to each gene in concert with its surrounding cellular and genomic environment. Lentiviruses such as HIV integrate their genomes into semi-random genomic locations in the cells they infect, and the resulting viral gene expression provides a natural system to dissect the contributions of genomic environment to transcriptional regulation. Previously, we showed that expression heterogeneity and its modulation by specific host factors at HIV integration sites are key determinants of infected-cell fate and a possible source of latent infections. Here, we assess the integration context dependence of expression heterogeneity from diverse single integrations of a HIV-promoter/GFP-reporter cassette in Jurkat T-cells. Systematically fitting a stochastic model of gene expression to our data reveals an underlying transcriptional dynamic, by which multiple transcripts are produced during short, infrequent bursts, that quantitatively accounts for the wide, highly skewed protein expression distributions observed in each of our clonal cell populations. Interestingly, we find that the size of transcriptional bursts is the primary systematic covariate over integration sites, varying from a few to tens of transcripts across integration sites, and correlating well with mean expression. In contrast, burst frequencies are scattered about a typical value of several per cell-division time and demonstrate little correlation with the clonal means. This pattern of modulation generates consistently noisy distributions over the sampled integration positions, with large expression variability relative to the mean maintained even for the most productive integrations, and could contribute to specifying heterogeneous, integration-site-dependent viral production patterns in HIV-infected cells. Genomic environment thus emerges as a significant control parameter for gene expression variation that may contribute to structuring mammalian genomes, as well as be exploited for survival by integrating viruses.},

Considerable progress has been made in recent years regarding how tumor cells circulating in the blood and lymphatic systems interact with and extravasate into secondary sites, and what determines whether these disseminated tumors cells survive, remain dormant or go on to form macrometastases. New insights into the routes that tumor cells take once leaving the primary tumor have emerged. Novel concepts regarding early seeding of metastases coupled to parallel progression, self-seeding of primary tumors by circulating tumor cells and the induction of premetastatic niches in distant organs by primary tumors have come to the fore. The perceived role of the lymphatic system in determining patterns of metastasis formation in distant organs has been reassessed. Together these new insights have the potential to offer new therapeutic options. In particular, the regulation of tumor cell dormancy emerges as a key event in metastasis formation, and therapeutic control of dormancy holds the promise of rendering cancer a chronic rather than life-threatening disease.},

Patients and methods: Patients with NSCLC were eligible for this phase II study if they had progressive disease within 3 months after first-line chemotherapy or progression while being treated with first-line chemotherapy. In 81 patients studied, two cohorts of patients were assigned based on whether the first-line therapy had included a platinum regimen. ALIMTA was administered at 500 mg/m2 by 10-min intravenous infusion once every 21 days. Results: The response rate in the 79 evaluable patients with poor prognostic features was 8.9\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.6\% to 15.1\%]. The response rate in the platinum-pretreated group was 4.5\% and 14.1\% in the non-platinum-pretreated group. The median duration of response was 6.8 months (95\% CI 3.4\textendash 7.8 months, 0\% censoring). The median survival time was 5.7 months (95\% CI 4.0\textendash 8.3 months, 7.6\% censoring). The probability of survival for at least 6 months was estimated to be 48\%. The median time to disease progression was 2 months (95\% CI 1.4\textendash 2.8 months, 0\% censoring). The principal toxicity was myelosuppression, which was reversible. Conclusions: ALIMTA is active in a second-line setting in non-platinum-pretreated NSCLC patients progressing within 3 months of first-line chemotherapy. This study demonstrates that it is possible to evaluate new drugs against NSCLC in a second-line setting.},

The vectors have been engineered so that the GST carrier can be cleaved from fusion proteins by digestion with site-specific proteases such as thrombin or blood coagulation factor Xa, following which, the carrier and any uncleaved fusion protein can be removed by absorption on glutathione-agarose.

Serine dehydratase and serine aminotransferase activities were absent, whereas 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and serine hydroxymethyltransferase activities were markedly increased in both tumour types. Serine hydroxymethyltransferase catalyses the formation of glycine and methylene tetrahydrofolate which are important precursors for nucleotide biosynthesis. The observed enzymic imbalance in these tumours ensures that an increased capacity for the synthesis of serine is coupled to its utilisation for nucleotide biosynthesis as a part of the biochemical commitment to cellular replication in cancer cells. That this pattern is found in sarcomas and carcinomas, and in tumours of human and rodent origin, signifies its universal importance for the biochemistry of the cancer cell and singles it out as a potential target site for anti-cancer chemotherapy.},

Our understanding of the molecular features of these noncoding RNAs is far from complete. We have identified a novel mRNA-like noncoding gene, named Gomafu, which is expressed in a distinct set of neurons in the mouse nervous system. Interestingly, spliced mature Gomafu RNA is localized to the nucleus despite its mRNA-like characteristics, which usually act as potent export signals to the cytoplasm. Within the nucleus, Gomafu RNA is detected as numerous spots that do not colocalize with known nuclear domain markers. Gomafu RNA is extremely insoluble and remains intact after nuclear matrix preparation. Furthermore, heterokaryon assays revealed that Gomafu RNA does not shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, but is retained in the nucleus after its transcription. We propose that Gomafu RNA represents a novel family of mRNA-like noncoding RNA that constitutes a cell-type-specific component of the nuclear matrix.},

  abstract = {The human body contains thousands of unique cell types, each with specialized functions. Cell identity is governed in large part by gene transcription programs, which are determined by regulatory elements encoded in DNA. To identify regulatory elements active in seven cell lines representative of diverse human cell types, we used DNase-seq and FAIRE-seq (Formaldehyde Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements) to map ``open chromatin.'' Over 870,000 DNaseI or FAIRE sites, which correspond tightly to nucleosome-depleted regions, were identified across the seven cell lines, covering nearly 9\% of the genome. The combination of DNaseI and FAIRE is more effective than either assay alone in identifying likely regulatory elements, as judged by coincidence with transcription factor binding locations determined in the same cells. Open chromatin common to all seven cell types tended to be at or near transcription start sites and to be coincident with CTCF binding sites, while open chromatin sites found in only one cell type were typically located away from transcription start sites and contained DNA motifs recognized by regulators of cell-type identity. We show that open chromatin regions bound by CTCF are potent insulators. We identified clusters of open regulatory elements (COREs) that were physically near each other and whose appearance was coordinated among one or more cell types. Gene expression and RNA Pol II binding data support the hypothesis that COREs control gene activity required for the maintenance of cell-type identity. This publicly available atlas of regulatory elements may prove valuable in identifying noncoding DNA sequence variants that are causally linked to human disease.},

To date, the primary evidence for CSCs derives from transplantation assays, which have known limitations. In particular, they are unable to report on the fate of cells within the original human tumor. Because of the difficulty in measuring tumor characteristics in patients, cellular organization and other aspects of cancer dynamics have not been quantified directly, although they likely play a fundamental role in tumor progression and therapy response. As such, new approaches to study CSCs in patient-derived tumor specimens are needed. In this study, we exploited ultradeep single-molecule genomic data derived from multiple microdissected colorectal cancer glands per tumor, along with a novel quantitative approach to measure tumor characteristics, define patient-specific tumor profiles, and infer tumor ancestral trees. We show that each cancer is unique in terms of its cellular organization, molecular heterogeneity, time from malignant transformation, and rate of mutation and apoptosis. Importantly, we estimate CSC fractions between 0.5\% and 4\%, indicative of a hierarchical organization responsible for long-lived CSC lineages, with variable rates of symmetric cell division. We also observed extensive molecular heterogeneity, both between and within individual cancer glands, suggesting a complex hierarchy of mitotic clones. Our framework enables the measurement of clinically relevant patient-specific characteristics in vivo, providing insight into the cellular organization and dynamics of tumor growth, with implications for personalized patient care.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the emergence of the tumor microenvironment as an essential ingredient of cancer malignancy, therapies targeting the host compartment of tumors have begun to be designed and applied in the clinic. CONTENT: The malignant features of cancer cells cannot be manifested without an important interplay between cancer cells and their local environment. The tumor infiltrate composed of immune cells, angiogenic vascular cells, lymphatic endothelial cells, and cancer-associated fibroblastic cells contributes actively to cancer progression. The ability to change these surroundings is an important property by which tumor cells are able to acquire some of the hallmark functions necessary for tumor growth and metastatic dissemination. Thus in the clinical setting the targeting of the tumor microenvironment to encapsulate or destroy cancer cells in their local environment has become mandatory. The variety of stromal cells, the complexity of the molecular components of the tumor stroma, and the similarity with normal tissue present huge challenges for therapies targeting the tumor microenvironment. These issues and their interplay are addressed in this review. After a decade of intensive clinical trials targeting cellular components of the tumor microenvironment, more recent investigations have shed light on the important role in cancer progression played by the noncellular stromal compartment composed of the extracellular matrix. SUMMARY: A better understanding of how the tumor environment affects cancer progression should provide new targets for the isolation and destruction of cancer cells via interference with the complex crosstalk established between cancer cells, host cells, and their surrounding extracellular matrix.},

In mammalian cells, protein levels also vary and individual cells differ widely in their responsiveness to uniform physiological stimuli. In the case of apoptosis mediated by TRAIL (tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) it is common for some cells in a clonal population to die while others survive-a striking divergence in cell fate. Among cells that die, the time between TRAIL exposure and caspase activation is highly variable. Here we image sister cells expressing reporters of caspase activation and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization after exposure to TRAIL. We show that naturally occurring differences in the levels or states of proteins regulating receptor-mediated apoptosis are the primary causes of cell-to-cell variability in the timing and probability of death in human cell lines. Protein state is transmitted from mother to daughter, giving rise to transient heritability in fate, but protein synthesis promotes rapid divergence so that sister cells soon become no more similar to each other than pairs of cells chosen at random. Our results have implications for understanding 'fractional killing' of tumour cells after exposure to chemotherapy, and for variability in mammalian signal transduction in general.},

Our data demonstrate that CTCF is directly involved in chromatin architecture and regulates local balance between active and repressive chromatin marks. We postulate that throughout the genome, relative position and stability of CTCF-mediated loops determine their effect on enhancer\textendash promoter interactions, with gene insulation as one possible outcome.},

Reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) by the transcription factors (TFs) OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and MYC offers an opportunity to address this question but is severely limited by the low proportion of responding cells. We have recently developed a highly efficient reprogramming protocol that synchronously converts somatic into pluripotent stem cells. Here, we used this system to integrate time-resolved changes in genome topology with gene expression, TF binding and chromatin-state dynamics. The results showed that TFs drive topological genome reorganization at multiple architectural levels, often before~changes in gene expression. Removal of locus-specific topological barriers can explain why pluripotency genes are activated sequentially, instead of simultaneously, during reprogramming. Together, our results implicate genome topology as an instructive force for implementing transcriptional programs and cell fate in mammals.},

Despite this progress, the precise physical nature of observed structures and the forces that govern their establishment remain poorly understood. Here we present high resolution Hi-C data from early Drosophila embryos. We demonstrate that boundaries between topological domains of various sizes map to DNA elements that resemble classical insulator elements: short genomic regions sensitive to DNase digestion that are strongly bound by known insulator proteins and are frequently located between divergent promoters. Further, we show a striking correspondence between these elements and the locations of mapped polytene interband regions. We believe it is likely this relationship between insulators, topological boundaries, and polytene interbands extends across the genome, and we therefore propose a model in which decompaction of boundary-insulator-interband regions drives the organization of interphase chromosomes by creating stable physical separation between adjacent domains.},

  abstract = {Engineering synthetic morphogens Morphogens provide positional information during tissue development. For this behavior to occur, morphogens must spread out and form a concentration gradient; however, their mechanism of transport remains a matter of debate. Stapornwongkul et al. now show that in the presence of extracellular binding elements (binders), the inert green fluorescent protein (GFP) can form a detectable concentration gradient by diffusion in the developing fly wing (see the Perspective by Barkai and Shilo). When combining the expression of nonsignaling binders and receptors engineered to respond to GFP, a synthetic GFP gradient can substitute for a natural morphogen to organize growth and patterning. In related work, Toda et al. also show that GFP can be converted into a morphogen by providing anchoring interactions that tether the molecule, forming a gradient that can be recognized by synthetic receptors that activate gene expression. These synthetic morphogens can be used to program de novo multidomain tissue patterns. These results highlight core mechanisms of morphogen signaling and patterning and provide ways to program spatial tissue organization independently from endogenous morphogen pathways. Science, this issue p. 321, p. 327; see also p. 292 Morphogen gradients provide positional information during development. To uncover the minimal requirements for morphogen gradient formation, we have engineered a synthetic morphogen in Drosophila wing primordia. We show that an inert protein, green fluorescent protein (GFP), can form a detectable diffusion-based gradient in the presence of surface-associated anti-GFP nanobodies, which modulate the gradient by trapping the ligand and limiting leakage from the tissue. We next fused anti-GFP nanobodies to the receptors of Dpp, a natural morphogen, to render them responsive to extracellular GFP. In the presence of these engineered receptors, GFP could replace Dpp to organize patterning and growth in vivo. Concomitant expression of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)\textendash anchored nonsignaling receptors further improved patterning, to near\textendash wild-type quality. Theoretical arguments suggest that GPI anchorage could be important for these receptors to expand the gradient length scale while at the same time reducing leakage. GFP can form a gradient in vivo and, with engineered GFP-responsive receptors, replace a morphogen that coordinates patterning and growth.

To decipher the sources and consequences of this noise, we systematically measured pairwise correlations between large numbers of genes, including those with high variability. We find that there is substantial pathway variability shared across similarly regulated genes. This induces quantitative correlations in the expression of functionally related genes such as those involved in the Msn2/4 stress response pathway, amino-acid~biosynthesis, and mitochondrial maintenance. Bioinformatic analyses and genetic perturbations suggest that fluctuations in PKA and Tor signaling contribute to pathway-specific variability. Our results argue that a limited number of well-delineated "noise regulons" operate across a yeast cell and that such coordinated fluctuations enable a stochastic but coherent induction of functionally related genes. Finally, we show that pathway noise is a quantitative tool for exploring pathway features and regulatory relationships in un-stimulated systems.},

This process of neuronal polarization is driven by the cytoskeleton. The first and decisive event during neuronal polarization is the specification of the axon. Distinct cytoskeletal dynamics and organization of the cytoskeleton determine the future axon while the other neurites become dendrites. Here, we will review how the cytoskeleton and its effectors drive axon specification and neuronal polarization. First, the role of the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules in axon specification will be presented. Then, we will discuss the role of the centrosome in axon determination as well as how microtubules are generated in axons and dendrites. Finally, we will discuss potential mechanisms leading to axon specification, such as positive feedback loops that could be a coordinated interaction between actin and microtubules. Together, this review will present the recent advances on the role of the microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton during neuronal polarization. We will pinpoint the upcoming challenges to gain a better understanding of neuronal polarization on a fundamental intracellular level. Finally, we will outline how reactivation of the intrinsic polarization program may help to induce axon regeneration after CNS injury.},

Tumour Treatment Fields (TTF), a completely new therapeutic modality in cancer treatment, physically interfere with cell division. METHODS: Phase III trial of chemotherapy-free treatment of NovoTTF (20-24h/day) versus active chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Primary end-point was improvement of overall survival. RESULTS: Patients (median age 54 years (range 23-80), Karnofsky performance status 80\% (range 50-100) were randomised to TTF alone (n=120) or active chemotherapy control (n=117). Number of prior treatments was two (range 1-6). Median survival was 6.6 versus 6.0 months (hazard ratio 0.86 [95\% CI 0.66-1.12]; p=0.27), 1-year survival rate was 20\% and 20\%, progression-free survival rate at 6 months was 21.4\% and 15.1\% (p=0.13), respectively in TTF and active control patients. Responses were more common in the TTF arm (14\% versus 9.6\%, p=0.19). The TTF-related adverse events were mild (14\%) to moderate (2\%) skin rash beneath the transducer arrays. Severe adverse events occurred in 6\% and 16\% (p=0.022) of patients treated with TTF and chemotherapy, respectively. Quality of life analyses favoured TTF therapy in most domains. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first controlled trial evaluating an entirely novel cancer treatment modality delivering electric fields rather than chemotherapy. No improvement in overall survival was demonstrated, however efficacy and activity with this chemotherapy-free treatment device appears comparable to chemotherapy regimens that are commonly used for recurrent glioblastoma. Toxicity and quality of life clearly favoured TTF.},

A few key parameters independently tuned the frequency of initiation and the duration of competence episodes and allowed the circuit to access different dynamic regimes, including oscillation. Altering circuit architecture showed that the duration of competence events can be made more precise. We used an experimental method to reduce global cellular noise and showed that noise levels are correlated with frequency of differentiation events. Together, the data reveal a noise-dependent circuit that is remarkably resilient and tunable in terms of its dynamic behavior.}

One hundred and forty-eight patients with primary early gastric cancer [IMC, 106; SMC, 42] were characterized for expression of cell cycle-related proteins and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). We also examined microsatellite instability (MSI) and methylation status. For LOH and methylation studies, we used a panel of 17 microsatellite markers (3p, 4p, 5q, 9p. 13q, 17p, 18q and 22q) and promoter regions of 9 genes (MLH-1, RUNX3, p16, HPP1, RASSF2A, SFRP1, DKK-1, ZFP64 and SALL4) that are frequently altered or methylated in gastric cancers. Overexpression of p53 and cyclin D1 was observed in SMC. In addition, low expression of p27 was more frequent in SMC than in IMC. Frequencies of 4p, 9p, 13q and 22q were significantly higher in SMC than in IMC. The SALL4 gene was frequently methylated in SMC compared with IMC. However, other gene methylations were common in both IMC and SMC. The frequency of LOH-high status/methylation-low status was significantly higher in SMC than in IMC. However, LOH-low status/methylation-high status in SMC was more frequently found in IMC. Our data confirm that methylation of cancer-related genes plays a major role in the development of IMCs. Importantly, the results also show that gastric submucosal progression is characterized by the accumulation of specific genetic alterations. In addition, changes of cell cycle-related proteins are associated with cancer progression.},

  abstract = {The Parkinson's disease (PD) evolves over an extended period of time with the onset occurring long before clinical signs begin to manifest. Characterization of the molecular events underlying the PD onset is instrumental for the development of diagnostic markers and preventive treatments, progress in this field is hindered by technical limitations. We applied an imaging approach to demonstrate the activation of Nrf2 transcription factor as a hallmark of neurodegeneration in neurotoxin-driven models of PD. In dopaminergic SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cells, Nrf2 activation was detected in cells committed to die as proven by time lapse microscopy; in the substantia nigra pars compacta area of the mouse brain, the Nrf2 activation preceded dopaminergic neurodegeneration as demonstrated by in vivo and ex vivo optical imaging, a finding confirmed by co-localization experiments carried out by immunohistochemistry. Collectively, our results identify the Nrf2 signaling as an early marker of neurodegeneration, anticipating dopaminergic neurodegeneration and motor deficits. Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy using retroviral vectors is a powerful and promising approach to permanently correct many hematopoietic disorders. Increasing the transduction of quiescent HSCs and reducing genotoxicity are major challenges in the field. Retroviral vectors, including lentiviral and foamy vectors, have been extensively modified resulting in improved safety and efficacy. This review will focus on recent advances to improve vector entry, transduction efficiency, control of transgene expression and approaches to improve safety by modifying the retroviral integration profile. C4 photosynthesis is a complex metabolic pathway responsible for carbon fixation in major feed, food and bioenergy crops. Although many enzymes driving this pathway have been identified, regulatory mechanisms underlying this system remain elusive. C4 photosynthesis contributes to photosynthetic efficiency in major bioenergy crops such as sugarcane, Miscanthus, switchgrass, maize and sorghum, and international efforts are underway to engineer C4 photosynthesis into C3 crops. A fundamental understanding of the C4 network is thus needed. New experimental and informatics methods can facilitate the accumulation and analysis of high-throughput data to define components of the C4 system. The use of new model plants, closely related to C4 crops, will also contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate this complex and important pathway. RNA polymerase III (Pol III) is one of three eukaryotic transcription complexes, and was identified as the complex responsible for production of transfer RNA and a limited number of other small RNAs. Pol III transcription at tRNA genes (tDNAs) requires the binding of two transcription factor complexes, TFIIIC and TFIIIB. Recent evidence points to a larger role for the Pol III transcription system in various other nuclear processes, including effects on nucleosome positioning, global genome and sub-nuclear organization, and direct effects on RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription. These effects are perhaps mediated by recruitment of a host of other chromatin proteins, including Pol II transcription factors and chromatin enzymes. Extra-TFIIIC sites (ETC sites) are chromosomal locations bound by TFIIIC without the rest of the Pol III complex, and bound TFIIIC alone is also able to mediate additional functions. These so called ``extra-transcriptional effects'' of the Pol III system are reviewed here, and a model is put forth suggesting that the TFIIIC transcription factor may act as a stably bound, global ``bookmark'' within chromatin to establish, maintain, or demarcate chromatin states as cells divide or change gene expression patterns.},

However, how the chromatin conformation of enhancer\textendash promoter interactions is affected by these events is unclear. In the present study, by comparing chromatin structure and H3K27ac levels in normal and lymphoma B cells, we show that enhancer\textendash promoter-interacting regions assume different conformations according to the local abundance of H3K27ac. Genetic or pharmacological depletion of H3K27ac decreases the frequency and the spreading of these interactions, altering oncogene expression. Moreover, enhancer hijacking mediated by chromosomal translocations influences the epigenetic status of the regions flanking the breakpoint, prompting the formation of distinct intrachromosomal interactions in the two homologous chromosomes. These interactions are accompanied by allele-specific gene expression changes. Overall, our work indicates that H3K27ac dynamics modulates interaction frequency between regulatory regions and can lead to allele-specific chromatin configurations to sustain oncogene expression.},

We hypothesize that neighboring genes on the same chromosome co-fluctuate in expression because of their common chromatin dynamics, and verify it at the genomic scale using allele-specific single-cell RNA-sequencing data of mouse cells. Unexpectedly, the co-fluctuation extends to genes that are over 60 million bases apart. We provide evidence that this long-range effect arises in part from chromatin co-accessibilities of linked loci attributable to three-dimensional proximity, which is much closer intra-chromosomally than inter-chromosomally. We further show that genes encoding components of the same protein complex tend to be chromosomally linked, likely resulting from natural selection for intracellular among-component dosage balance. These findings have implications for both the evolution of genome organization and optimal design of synthetic genomes in the face of gene expression noise.},

  abstract = {Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) allow rapid and efficient gene delivery in the nervous system. AAVs are widely used in research and are the basis of multiple FDA-approved gene therapies. Here, we find that the immune response to AAV's genome reduces dendritic complexity in mammalian cortex. Dendritic loss associated with AAV-mediated gene delivery occurs at experimentally-relevant titers, cannot be explained by responses to transgene expression or surgery, and is not restricted to a particular capsid serotype, encoded transgene, promoter, or production facility. AAV-associated dendritic loss is accompanied by a decrease in the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and upregulation of immune molecules that can limit dendritic complexity and synaptic transmission. Blocking detection of unmethylated CpG-rich DNA via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) protects dendritic complexity, suggesting that immunodetection of a core feature of the AAV genome triggers dendritic loss. These results reveal previously unsuspected impacts of AAV on neuronal structure and function and identify TLR9 inhibitors as important tools to improve the safety and efficacy of AAV-mediated gene delivery in the nervous system.},

We describe how such bursts generate gene-specific temporal patterns of messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis in mammalian cells. To monitor transcription at high temporal resolution, we established various gene trap cell lines and transgenic cell lines expressing a short-lived luciferase protein from an unstable mRNA, and recorded bioluminescence in real time in single cells. Mathematical modeling identified gene-specific on- and off-switching rates in transcriptional activity and mean numbers of mRNAs produced during the bursts. Transcriptional kinetics were markedly altered by cis-regulatory DNA elements. Our analysis demonstrated that bursting kinetics are highly gene-specific, reflecting refractory periods during which genes stay inactive for a certain time before switching on again.},

Transgenic lines were selected by spectinomycin resistance and distinguished from spontaneous mutants by the flanking, cotransformed streptomycin resistance and Pst I markers. Regenerated plants are homoplasmic for the spectinomycin resistance and the Pst I markers and heteroplasmic for the unselected streptomycin resistance trait. Transgenic plastid traits are transmitted to the seed progeny.

  abstract = {Gene expression is a stochastic, or ``noisy,'' process. This noise comes about in two ways. The inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes such as transcription and translation generates ``intrinsic'' noise. In addition, fluctuations in the amounts or states of other cellular components lead indirectly to variation in the expression of a particular gene and thus represent ``extrinsic'' noise. Here, we show how the total variation in the level of expression of a given gene can be decomposed into its intrinsic and extrinsic components. We demonstrate theoretically that simultaneous measurement of two identical genes per cell enables discrimination of these two types of noise. Analytic expressions for intrinsic noise are given for a model that involves all the major steps in transcription and translation. These expressions give the sensitivity to various parameters, quantify the deviation from Poisson statistics, and provide a way of fitting experiment. Transcription dominates the intrinsic noise when the average number of proteins made per mRNA transcript is greater than {$\simeq$}2. Below this number, translational effects also become important. Gene replication and cell division, included in the model, cause protein numbers to tend to a limit cycle. We calculate a general form for the extrinsic noise and illustrate it with the particular case of a single fluctuating extrinsic variable\textemdash a repressor protein, which acts on the gene of interest. All results are confirmed by stochastic simulation using plausible parameters for Escherichia coli.},

Remarkably, these domains correlate strongly with the recently described TADs, which partition the genome into distinct self-interacting blocks. Different features, including specific repeats and CTCF-binding sites, correlate with the transition zones separating regulatory domains, and may help to further organize promiscuously distributed regulatory influences within large domains. These findings support a model of genomic organization where TADs confine regulatory activities to specific but large regulatory domains, contributing to the establishment of specific gene expression profiles.},

We show that Shh enhancers act pervasively, yet not uniformly, throughout the TAD. Importantly, changing intra-TAD distances had no impact on Shh expression. In contrast, inversions disrupting the TAD altered global folding of the region and prevented regulatory contacts in a distance-dependent manner. Our data indicate that the Shh TAD promotes distance-independent contacts between distant regions that would otherwise interact only sporadically, enabling functional communication between them. In large genomes where genomic distances per se can limit regulatory interactions, this function of TADs could be as essential for gene expression as the formation of insulated neighborhoods.},

  abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms that underlie chromosome folding within cell nuclei is essential to determine the relationship between genome structure and function. The recent application of ``chromosome conformation capture'' techniques has revealed that the genome of many species is organized into domains of preferential internal chromatin interactions called ``topologically associating domains'' (TADs). This chromosome compartmentalization has emerged as a key feature of higher-order genome organization and function through evolution. Although TADs have now been described in a wide range of organisms, they appear to have specific characteristics in terms of size, structure, and proteins involved in their formation. Here, we depict the main features of these domains across species and discuss the relation between chromatin structure, genome activity, and epigenome, highlighting mechanistic principles of TAD formation. We also consider the potential influence of TADs in genome evolution. This review discusses the features of TADs across species, and their role in chromosome organization, genome function, and evolution.

However, how TADs fold in single cells is elusive. Here, we reveal TAD features inaccessible to cell population analysis by using super-resolution microscopy. TAD structures and physical insulation associated with their borders are variable between individual cells, yet chromatin intermingling is enriched within TADs compared to adjacent TADs in most cells. The spatial segregation of TADs is further exacerbated during cell differentiation. Favored interactions within TADs are regulated by cohesin and CTCF through distinct mechanisms: cohesin generates chromatin contacts and intermingling while CTCF prevents inter-TAD contacts. Furthermore, TADs are subdivided into discrete nanodomains, which persist in cells depleted of CTCF or cohesin, whereas disruption of nucleosome contacts alters their structural organization. Altogether, these results provide a physical basis for the folding of individual chromosomes at the nanoscale.},

  abstract = {Deciphering the rules of genome folding in the cell nucleus is essential to understand its functions. Recent chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) studies have revealed that the genome is partitioned into topologically associating domains (TADs), which demarcate functional epigenetic domains defined by combinations of specific chromatin marks. However, whether TADs are true physical units in each cell nucleus or whether they reflect statistical frequencies of measured interactions within cell populations is unclear. Using a combination of Hi-C, three-dimensional (3D) fluorescent in situ hybridization, super-resolution microscopy, and polymer modeling, we provide an integrative view of chromatin folding in Drosophila. We observed that repressed TADs form a succession of discrete nanocompartments, interspersed by less condensed active regions. Single-cell analysis revealed a consistent TAD-based physical compartmentalization of the chromatin fiber, with some degree of heterogeneity in intra-TAD conformations and in cis and trans inter-TAD contact events. These results indicate that TADs are fundamental 3D genome units that engage in dynamic higher-order inter-TAD connections. This domain-based architecture is likely to play a major role in regulatory transactions during DNA-dependent processes. Drosophila chromosomes are organized in a series of nanocompartments that correspond to topologically associating domains.

  abstract = {We have introduced the nlacZ reporter gene into the locus of the myogenic factor gene myf-5 by homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Targeted ES clones were injected into precompaction morula, and the {$\beta$}-galactosidase expression pattern was monitored. These mice permit the sensitive visualization of myf-5 expression throughout the embryo, and provide a standard for comparing it with that seen with different myf-5/nlacZ transgenes. Thus, in a comparison using ES cells in chiameric embryos containing the targeted or randomly integrated myf-5/nlacZ construct, we demonstrate that 5.5 kbp of myf-5 upstream flanking sequence including exon1 and most of intron1 directs some skeletal muscle expression, but this is neither qualitatively nor quantitatively equivalent to that of the endogenous gene. Myf-5 is expressed early, before terminal myogenesis takes place in the medial half of the somite, and subsequently it is a major myogenic factor as skeletal muscle forms. All skeletal muscle shows {$\beta$}-galactosidase activity, even after birth, indicating that myf-5 expression is not confined to primary myotubes, which are derived from embryonic myoblasts, but is also present in muscles containing different adult fibre types. The presence of myf-5 transcripts from the endogenous gene in older muscle was confirmed by in situ hybridization. These results suggest that the myf-5 gene is not activated in only a subset of muscle cells and are consistent with the results on the MyoD knockout mice. \textcopyright{} 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Because individual cells appear to be highly variable at all these levels5, it is essential to map different modalities in the same cells. Here we report the imaging of 3,660 chromosomal loci in single mouse embryonic stem~(ES) cells using DNA seqFISH+, along with 17 chromatin marks and subnuclear structures by sequential immunofluorescence and the expression profile of 70 RNAs. Many loci were invariably associated with immunofluorescence marks in single mouse ES cells. These loci form `fixed points' in the nuclear organizations of single cells and often appear on the surfaces of nuclear bodies and zones defined by combinatorial chromatin marks. Furthermore, highly expressed genes appear to be pre-positioned to active nuclear zones, independent of bursting dynamics in single cells. Our analysis also uncovered several distinct mouse ES cell subpopulations with characteristic combinatorial chromatin states. Using clonal analysis, we show that the global levels of some chromatin marks, such as H3 trimethylation at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and macroH2A1 (mH2A1), are heritable over at least 3\textendash 4 generations, whereas other marks fluctuate on a faster time scale. This seqFISH+-based spatial multimodal approach can be used to explore nuclear organization and cell states in diverse biological systems.},

Here we show that long-range activation using CRISPR-based aTFs in human cells can be made more efficient and reliable by concurrently targeting an aTF to the target gene promoter. We used this strategy to direct target gene choice for enhancers capable of regulating more than one promoter and to achieve allele-selective activation of human genes by targeting aTFs to single-nucleotide polymorphisms embedded in distally located sequences.

  abstract = {Although unlimited proliferation of cancer cells is supported by multiple signaling pathways involved in the regulation of proliferation, survival, and apoptosis, the molecular mechanisms coordinating these different pathways to promote the proliferation and survival of cancer cells have remained unclear. SAPK and integrin-ILK signaling pathways play key roles in the promotion of apoptosis and cell proliferation/survival, respectively. Studies of TNF{$\alpha$}- and H2O2-induced apoptosis revealed that ASK1, a component of the SAPK system, mediates the TNF{$\alpha$} and H2O2 signaling of apoptosis. ASK1 is activated by autophosphorylation of a specific threonine residue (T845) following TNF{$\alpha$} stimulation. Our recent studies indicate that PP2C{$\varepsilon$}, a member of the PP2C family, associates with and inactivates ASK1 by dephosphorylating T845. In contrast, PP2C{$\delta$}/ILKAP, a second PP2C family member, activates ASK1 by enhancing cellular phosphorylation of T845. PP2C{$\delta$}/ILKAP also forms a complex with ILK1 to inhibit the GSK3{$\beta$}-mediated integrin-ILK1 signaling in vivo, inhibiting cell cycle progression. These observations raise the possibility that PP2C{$\delta$}/ILKAP acts to control the cross-talk between integrin-induced and TNF{$\alpha$}-induced signaling pathways, inhibiting the former and stimulating the latter, thereby inhibiting proliferation and survival and promoting the apoptosis of cancer cells.

Numerous mechanisms contribute to its origins, yet the mechanisms behind large fluctuations that are induced by single transcriptional activators remain elusive. Here, we probed putative mechanisms by studying the dynamic regulation of transcriptional activator binding, histone regulator inhibitors, chromatin accessibility, and levels of mRNAs and proteins in single cells. Using a light-induced expression system, we showed that the transcriptional activator could form an interplay with dual functional co-activator/histone acetyltransferases CBP/p300. This interplay resulted in substantial heterogeneity in H3K27ac, chromatin accessibility, and transcription. Simultaneous attenuation of CBP/p300 and HDAC4/5 reduced heterogeneity in the expression of endogenous genes, suggesting that this mechanism is universal. We further found that the noise was reduced by pulse-wide modulation of transcriptional activator binding possibly as a result of alternating the epigenetic states. Our findings suggest a mechanism for the modulation of noise in synthetic and endogenous gene expression systems.},

While transient inhibition of KSP leads to reversible mitotic arrest, prolonged exposure to a KSP inhibitor induces apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis by the KSP inhibitor couples with mitotic slippage. Slippage-refractory cells show resistance to KSP inhibitor-mediated lethality, whereas promotion of slippage after mitotic arrest enhances apoptosis.

  abstract = {Microparticle bombardment technology has evolved as a method for delivering exogenous nucleic acids into plant cells and is a commonly employed technique in plant science. Desired genetic material is precipitated onto micron-sized metal particles and placed within one of a variety of devices designed to accelerate these "microcarriers" to velocities required to penetrate the plant cell wall. In this manner, transgenes can be delivered into the cell's genome or plastome. Since the late 1980s microparticle bombardment has become a powerful tool for the study of gene expression and production of stably transformed tissues and whole transgenic plants for experimental purposes and agricultural applications. This paper reviews development and application of the technology, including the protocols and mechanical systems employed as delivery systems, and the types of plant cells and culture systems employed to generate effective "targets" for receiving the incoming genetic material. Current understanding of how the exogenous DNA becomes integrated into the plant's native genetic background are assessed as are methods for improving the efficiency of this process. Pros and cons of particle bombardment technologies compared to alternative direct gene transfer methods and Agrobacterium based transformation systems are discussed.},

The ras signaling pathway is activated in several cancers and has been found to stimulate glycolytic flux to lactate. Glycolysis is regulated by ras via the activity of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatases (PFK2/FBPase), which modulate the intracellular concentration of the allosteric glycolytic activator, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP). We report herein that sequential immortalization and ras-transformation of mouse fibroblasts or human bronchial epithelial cells paradoxically decreases the intracellular concentration of F2,6BP. This marked reduction in the intracellular concentration of F2,6BP sensitizes transformed cells to the antimetabolic effects of PFK2/FBPase inhibition. Moreover, despite co-expression of all four mRNA species (PFKFB1-4), heterozygotic genomic deletion of the inducible PFKFB3 gene in ras-transformed mouse lung fibroblasts suppresses F2,6BP production, glycolytic flux to lactate, and growth as soft agar colonies or tumors in athymic mice. These data indicate that the PFKFB3 protein product may serve as an essential downstream metabolic mediator of oncogenic ras, and we propose that pharmacologic inhibition of this enzyme should selectively suppress the high rate of glycolysis and growth by cancer cells.},

Evidence, showing that beta-amyloid causes that loss is weak despite the popularity of that hypothesis. Other changes can better explain that damaging phenomenon. Axonal terminals are dependent on axoplasmic flow, and that function requires intact microtubules and the motor proteins kinesin, dynein and dynamin. It has been known since the earliest electron microscopic studies of AD that neuronal microtubules are lessened in number. Tubules are normally in equilibrium with unpolymerized tubulin, and the stability of the formed elements is dependent on normal binding of tau to the tubule. But, as is well known, tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated in AD leading to tangle formation and to dissolution of the tubules. Tangles are insufficient in number to account for the cortical loss of neurons and synapses, but hyperphosphorylated tau in the unpolymerized pre-tangle state undoubtedly plays a role. Abnormalities in the motor proteins are now being investigated (some have already been found) and these too would contribute to the loss of synapses in AD by way diminished axoplasmic flow.},

We show that a majority of promoter-anchored contacts are lost in these conditions, but many contacts with distinct properties are maintained, and some new ones are gained. The rewiring of contacts between promoters and active enhancers upon cohesin degradation associates with rapid changes in target gene transcription as detected by SLAM sequencing (SLAM-seq). These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the limited, but consistent, effects of cohesin and CTCF depletion on steady-state transcription and suggest the existence of both cohesin-dependent and -independent mechanisms of enhancer-promoter pairing.},

The results show that tRNA genes, though dispersed in the linear genome, colocalize with 5S ribosomal DNA and U14 small nucleolar RNA at the nucleolus. Nucleolar localization requires tRNA gene transcription-complex formation, because inactivation of the promoter at a single locus removes its nucleolar association. This organization of tRNA genes must profoundly affect the spatial packaging of the genome and raises the question of whether gene types might be coordinated in three dimensions to regulate transcription.},

  abstract = {Intracellullar trafficking of lipids is fundamental to membrane biogenesis. For the synthesis of sphingomyelin, ceramide is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus by the ceramide transfer protein CERT. CERT is phosphorylated by protein kinase D at S132 and subsequently multiple times in a serine-repeat motif, resulting in its inactivation. However, the kinase involved in the multiple phosphorylation remains unclear. Here, we identify the gamma2 isoform of casein kinase I (CKIgamma2) as a kinase whose overexpression confers sphingomyelin-directed toxin-resistance to Chinese hamster ovary cells. In a transformant stably expressing CKIgamma2, CERT was hyperphosphorylated, and the intracellular trafficking of ceramide was retarded, thereby reducing de novo sphingomyelin synthesis. The reduction in the synthesis of sphingomyelin caused by CKIgamma2 was reversed by the expression of CERT mutants that are not hyperphosphorylated. Furthermore, CKIgamma2 directly phosphorylated CERT in vitro. Among three gamma isoforms, only knockdown of gamma2 isoform caused drastic changes in the ratio of hypo- to hyperphosphorylated form of CERT in HeLa cells. These results indicate that CKIgamma2 hyperphosphorylates the serine-repeat motif of CERT, thereby inactivating CERT and down-regulating the synthesis of sphingomyelin.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Cell cycle-related events in CCRF-CEM lymphocytic leukemia cells were examined subsequent to inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TS) or GAR formyltransferase (GARFT) and prior to cell death or stasis. Methods: Cell populations were treated with the GARFT inhibitors 6R-5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate (lometrexol) or LY309887, the TS inhibitor ZD1694, or the multitargeted antifolate LY231514. DNA content, nucleoside precursor incorporation and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression as functions of drug treatment were assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry. Cellular respiration was measured by MTT analysis and apoptosis was detected by extraction of DNA fragments. Results: Cell populations treated for up to 96 h with lometrexol or LY309887 did not replicate and maintained a cell cycle distribution with distinct G1, S and G2/M regions. The number of S phase cells in treated populations was slightly elevated relative to control as measured by DNA content and PCNA. However, these cells were unable to incorporate 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Throughout treatment, cells incubated with GARFT inhibitors maintained intact membranes and respired at a level comparable to untreated cells. In contrast, ZD1694 as well as LY231514, induced synchronization of the treatment population at the G1/S interface within 12 h of drug addition. This was followed by synchronous entry of the population into S phase. After 24 h of treatment, more than 90\% of the cells were capable of incorporating BrdU and stained positive for PCNA. DNA fragmentation occurred in cells treated with ZD1694 or LY231514 but not in those treated with GARFT inhibitors. In addition, the viable cells remaining after 24\textendash 48 h of treatment with ZD1694 or LY231514 were respiring at twice the level of untreated cells. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that the distinct endpoints of GARFT and TS inhibition are preceded by distinct cell cycle and metabolic alterations.},

We used CRISPR\textendash Cas9 genetic screens to identify genes that affect cell fate decisions by altering cellular plasticity. We found that many factors can independently affect cellular priming and fate decisions. We discovered a new plasticity-based mode of increasing resistance to BRAF inhibition that pushes cells towards a more differentiated state. Manipulating cellular plasticity through inhibition of DOT1L before the addition of the BRAF inhibitor resulted in more therapy resistance than concurrent administration.

Our simulations identified a possible mechanism that explains life-long maintenance of ASE neuron fate in Caenorhabditis elegans by the terminal selector transcription factor CHE-1. Here, fluctuations in CHE-1 level are buffered by the reservoir of CHE-1 bound at its target promoters, which ensures continued che-1 expression by preferentially binding the che-1 promoter. We provide experimental evidence for this mechanism by showing that che-1 expression was resilient to induced transient CHE-1 depletion, while both expression of CHE-1 targets and ASE function were lost. We identified a 130 bp che-1 promoter fragment responsible for this resilience, with deletion of a homeodomain binding site in this fragment causing stochastic loss of ASE identity long after its determination. Because network architectures that support this mechanism are highly conserved in cell differentiation, it may explain stable cell fate maintenance in many systems.},

We demonstrate that MALAT1 levels are regulated during normal cell cycle progression. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses in normal human diploid fibroblasts reveal that MALAT1 modulates the expression of cell cycle genes and is required for G1/S and mitotic progression. Depletion of MALAT1 leads to activation of p53 and its target genes. The cell cycle defects observed in MALAT1-depleted cells are sensitive to p53 levels, indicating that p53 is a major downstream mediator of MALAT1 activity. Furthermore, MALAT1-depleted cells display reduced expression of B-MYB (Mybl2), an oncogenic transcription factor involved in G2/M progression, due to altered binding of splicing factors on B-MYB pre-mRNA and aberrant alternative splicing. In human cells, MALAT1 promotes cellular proliferation by modulating the expression and/or pre-mRNA processing of cell cycle-regulated transcription factors. These findings provide mechanistic insights on the role of MALAT1 in regulating cellular proliferation.},

In the present study, we provide evidence for a role for the long nuclear-retained regulatory RNA (nrRNA), MALAT1 in AS regulation. MALAT1 interacts with SR proteins and influences the distribution of these and other splicing factors in nuclear speckle domains. Depletion of MALAT1 or overexpression of an SR protein changes the AS of a similar set of endogenous pre-mRNAs. Furthermore, MALAT1 regulates cellular levels of phosphorylated forms of SR proteins. Taken together, our results suggest that MALAT1 regulates AS by modulating the levels of active SR proteins.

However, recent studies conclude that also the physico-chemical properties of the AD can control TF assembly at chromatin via driving a phase separation into "transcriptional condensates". Here, we dissected the mechanism of transcription activation at a reporter gene array with real-time single-cell fluorescence microscopy readouts. Our comparison of different synthetic TFs reveals that the phase separation propensity of the AD correlates with high transcription activation capacity by increasing binding site occupancy, residence time and the recruitment of co-activators. However, we find that the actual formation of phase separated TF liquid-like droplets has a neutral or inhibitory effect on transcription induction. Thus, our study suggests that the ability of a TF to phase separate reflects the functionally important property of the AD to establish multivalent interactions but does not by itself enhance transcription.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Although recent studies have revealed the functional relevance of Gomafu in a series of physiological processes, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely uncharacterized. In this report, we identified a chicken homologue of Gomafu using a comparative genomic approach to search for functionally important and conserved sequence motifs among evolutionarily distant species. Unexpectedly, we found that all Gomafu RNA examined shared a distinctive feature: tandem repeats of UACUAAC, a sequence that has been identified as a conserved intron branch point in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The tandem UACUAAC Gomafu RNA repeats bind to the SF1 splicing factor with a higher affinity than the divergent branch point sequence in mammals, which affects the kinetics of the splicing reaction in vitro. We propose that the Gomafu RNA regulates splicing efficiency by changing the local concentration of splicing factors within the nucleus.},

In human induced pluripotent stem cells, STITCH inserted between MYC and the enhancer down-regulated MYC. Progressive mutagenesis of STITCH led to a preferential escalation of the gene-enhancer interaction, corroborating the strong insulation ability of STITCH. STITCH also altered epigenetic states around MYC. Time-course analysis by drug induction uncovered deposition and removal of H3K27me3 repressive marks follows and reflects, but does not precede and determine, the expression change.

The mechanisms by which this effect is achieved are controversial; although some previous studies have suggested that codon bias is the most important determinant of translation efficiency, a recent study suggested that mRNA folding at the beginning of genes is the dominant factor via its effect on translation initiation. Using the Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptomes, we conducted a genome-scale study aiming at dissecting the determinants of translation efficiency. There is a significant association between codon bias and translation efficiency across all endogenous genes in E. coli and S. cerevisiae but no association between folding energy and translation efficiency, demonstrating the role of codon bias as an important determinant of translation efficiency. However, folding energy does modulate the strength of association between codon bias and translation efficiency, which is maximized at very weak mRNA folding (i.e., high folding energy) levels. We find a strong correlation between the genomic profiles of ribosomal density and genomic profiles of folding energy across mRNA, suggesting that lower folding energies slow down the ribosomes and decrease translation efficiency. Accordingly, we find that selection forces act near uniformly to decrease the folding energy at the beginning of genes. In summary, these findings testify that in endogenous genes, folding energy affects translation efficiency in a global manner that is not related to the expression levels of individual genes, and thus cannot be detected by correlation with their expression levels.},

Here, we show that in both nontransformed human fibroblasts and HeLa cells, cdc25C protein levels significantly increased concomitant with S-phase onset and cyclin A synthesis. Activity measurements on immunoprecipitates from synchronized HeLa cells revealed a sharp rise in cdc25C-associated phosphatase activity that coincided with S-phase. Microinjection of various antisense-cdc25C molecules led to inhibition of DNA synthesis in both HeLa cells and human fibroblasts. Furthermore, transfection of small interfering RNA directed against cdc25C specifically depleted cdc25C in HeLa cells without affecting cdc25A or cdc25B levels. Cdc25C RNA interference was also accompanied by S-phase inhibition. In cells depleted of cdc25C by antisense or siRNA, normal cell cycle progression could be re-established through microinjection of wild-type cdc25C protein but not inactive C377S mutant protein. Taken together, these results show that cdc25C not only plays a role at the G2/M transition but also in the modulation of DNA replication where its function is distinct from that of cdc25A.},

  abstract = {Plant growth is driven by cell proliferation and elongation [1]. The hormone gibberellin (GA) regulates Arabidopsis root growth [2,3,4,5] by controlling cell elongation [6], but it is currently unknown whether GA also controls root cell proliferation. Here we show that GA biosynthetic mutants are unable to increase their cell production rate and meristem size after germination. GA signals the degradation of the DELLA growth repressor proteins [7,8,9,10,11,12] GAI and RGA, promoting root cell production. Targeting the expression of gai (a non-GA-degradable mutant form of GAI) in the root meristem disrupts cell proliferation. Moreover, expressing gai in dividing endodermal cells was sufficient to block root meristem enlargement. We report a novel function for GA regulating cell proliferation where this signal acts by removing DELLA in a subset of, rather than all, meristem cells. We suggest that the GA-regulated rate of expansion of dividing endodermal cells dictates the equivalent rate in other root tissues. Cells must double in size prior to dividing but cannot do so independently, because they are physically restrained by adjacent tissues with which they share cell walls. Our study highlights the importance of probing regulatory mechanisms linking molecular- and cellular-scale processes with tissue and organ growth responses.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite significant advances in the treatment of intrahepatic lesions, the prognosis for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have extrahepatic metastasis remains poor. The objective of this study was to further elucidate the clinical course and prognostic determinants of patients with this disease. METHODS: In total, 342 patients who had HCC with extrahepatic metastasis were enrolled. The metastases were diagnosed at initial presentation with HCC in 28 patients and during follow-up in the remaining patients. The authors analyzed clinical features, prognoses, and treatments and established a scoring system to predict prognosis using a split-sample method with a testing set and a training set. RESULTS: The most frequent site of extrahepatic metastasis was the lung followed by lymph nodes, bone, and adrenal glands. These metastases were related directly to death in only 23 patients (7.6\%). The median survival after diagnosis of extrahepatic metastasis was 8.1 months (range, 0.03-108.7 months). In univariate analysis of the training set (n = 171), performance status, Child-Pugh classification, the number and size of intrahepatic lesions, macroscopic vascular invasion, symptomatic extrahepatic metastases, {$\alpha$}-fetoprotein levels, and complete responses to treatment were associated significantly with prognosis. On the basis of multivariate analysis, a scoring system was developed to predict prognosis that assessed uncontrollable intrahepatic lesions, extent of vascular invasion, and performance status. This scoring system was validated in the testing set (n = 171) and produced a concordance index of 0.73. CONCLUSIONS: The controllability of intrahepatic lesions and performance status were identified as important prognostic factors in patients with advanced HCC who had extrahepatic metastasis.

Altered tyrosine phosphorylation signals in cancer cells contribute to a number of aberrant characteristics involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. CUB domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1) is a substrate of Src family kinases and has been shown to regulate anoikis resistance, migration and matrix degradation during tumor invasion and metastasis in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner. Knockdown of CDCP1 blocks tumor metastasis or peritoneal dissemination in vivo, without significantly affecting cell proliferation. Moreover, expression levels of CDCP1 are of prognostic value in several cancers. Here, we summarize the studies on CDCP1, focusing on structure and signal transduction, to gain insight into its role in cancer progression. Understanding the signaling pathways regulated by CDCP1 could help establish novel therapeutic strategies against the progression of cancer. (Cancer Sci 2011; 102: 1943\textendash 1948)},

These contain heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1) and a specific subset of pre-mRNA processing factors. Nuclear stress bodies are assembled on specific pericentromeric heterochromatic domains containing satellite III (SatIII) DNA. In response to stress, these domains change their epigenetic status from heterochromatin to euchromatin and are transcribed in poly-adenylated RNAs that remain associated with nSBs. In this article, we describe the cloning, sequencing, and functional characterization of these transcripts. They are composed of SatIII repeats and originate from the transcription of multiple sites within the SatIII arrays. Interestingly, the level of SatIII RNAs can be down-regulated both by antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNAs (siRNA). Knockdown of SatIII RNA by siRNAs requires the activity of Argonaute 2, a component of the RNA-induced silencing complex. Down-regulation of satellite III RNAs significantly affects the recruitment of RNA processing factors to nSBs without altering the association of HSF-1 with these structures nor the presence of acetylated histones within nSBs. Thus, satellite III RNAs have a major role in the formation of nSBs.},

  abstract = {Cell-to-cell variance in protein levels (noise) is a ubiquitous phenomenon that can increase fitness by generating phenotypic differences within clonal populations of cells. An important challenge is to identify the specific molecular events that control noise. This task is complicated by the strong dependence of a protein's cell-to-cell variance on its mean expression level through a power-law like relationship ({$\sigma$}2{$\propto\mu$}1.69). Here, we dissect the nature of this relationship using a stochastic model parameterized with experimentally measured values. This framework naturally recapitulates the power-law like relationship ({$\sigma$}2{$\propto\mu$}1.6) and accurately predicts protein variance across the yeast proteome (r2 = 0.935). Using this model we identified two distinct mechanisms by which protein variance can be increased. Variables that affect promoter activation, such as nucleosome positioning, increase protein variance by changing the exponent of the power-law relationship. In contrast, variables that affect processes downstream of promoter activation, such as mRNA and protein synthesis, increase protein variance in a mean-dependent manner following the power-law. We verified our findings experimentally using an inducible gene expression system in yeast. We conclude that the power-law-like relationship between noise and protein mean is due to the kinetics of promoter activation. Our results provide a framework for understanding how molecular processes shape stochastic variation across the genome.},

We found that the Drosophila special chromatin structure insulator completely blocks transcriptional repression mediated by all of the repressors we tested. The Drosophilagypsy insulator was able to block the repression mediated by the PcG proteins Su(z)2 and RING1, as well as mHP1, but not the repression mediated by MeCP2 and the PcG protein HPC2. The 5{${'}$}-located DNase I-hypersensitive site in the chicken {$\beta$}-globin locus displayed a limited ability to block repression, and a matrix or scaffold attachment region element was entirely unable to block repression mediated by any repressor tested. Our results indicate that insulators can block repression mediated by PcG proteins and other chromatin-associated repressors, but with a high level of selectivity. This high degree of specificity may provide a useful assay to define and characterize distinct classes of insulators.},

Our model dramatically outperforms models using genomic proximity and can be used to determine the quantitative impact of enhancer loss on gene expression in different genetic backgrounds.

To understand how TBP activity is regulated in a genome-wide manner, we profiled the binding of TBP, NC2, Mot1p, TFIID, SAGA, and pol II across the yeast genome using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)\textendash chip for cells in exponential growth and during reprogramming of transcription. We find that TBP, NC2, and Mot1p colocalize at transcriptionally active pol II core promoters. Relative binding of NC2{$\alpha$} and Mot1p is higher at TATA promoters, whereas NC2{$\beta$} has a preference for TATA-less promoters. In line with the ChIP\textendash chip data, we isolated a stable TBP\textendash NC2\textendash Mot1p\textendash DNA complex from chromatin extracts. ATP hydrolysis releases NC2 and DNA from the Mot1p\textendash TBP complex. In vivo experiments indicate that promoter dissociation of TBP and NC2 is highly dynamic, which is dependent on Mot1p function. Based on these results, we propose that NC2 and Mot1p cooperate to dynamically restrict TBP activity on transcribed promoters.},

  abstract = {The Drosophila 87A7 heat shock locus is bordered, on the proximal and distal sides, by two special chromatin structures, scs and scs'. Each structure is characterized by two sets of nuclease-hypersensitive sites, located within moderately G/C-rich DNA, flanking an A/T-rich nuclease-resistant region. scs and scs' have been shown to insulate a white reporter gene from position effects and to prevent enhancer-promoter interactions. These and other properties suggest scs and scs' might function as chromatin domain boundaries. To identify the DNA sequences which are essential for the insulating activity of scs we used an enhancer blocking assay based on the white gene. Sequences capable of suppressing activation of white by its upstream enhancer elements reside within a 900 bp DNA fragment corresponding to the scs chromatin structure. Within this region, DNA fragments associated with the two nuclease-hypersensitive regions are essential for full enhancer blocking activity, while the central A/T-rich region is dispensable. Deletions which remove part of the hypersensitive regions result in intermediate levels of white activity. Insulating activity can, however, be reconstituted by multimerizing DNA fragments from either hypersensitive region. Our results suggest that the scs boundary is assembled from a discrete number of functionally redundant DNA sequences located within both hypersensitive regions and that boundaries act by decreasing the frequency of enhancer-promoter interactions. We also show that certain types of position effects, like those involved in dosage compensation, are not efficiently blocked by scs.},

However, little is known about the association between Survivin variants (Survivin-2B, Survivin-{$\Delta$}Ex3, Survivin-3B, and Survivin-2{$\alpha$}) and the other apoptotic-related genes. In this study, we analyzed the apoptosis gene signature of Survivin and its variant expression in breast cancer. Human Apoptosis Gene Arrays were used to screen genes that could be associated with Survivin variants. Expression of the five transcripts was measured by RT-PCR in 135 breast carcinomas and Cox survival analysis was analyzed according to the patient outcome. Significant associations between Survivin transcripts and apoptotic genes were found. Interestingly, Survivin-3B variant showed major inverse correlations with pro-apoptotic genes. In addition, in vitro results indicated that overexpression of Survivin-3B strongly inhibits 5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide-induced apoptosis in breast tumor cell lines. In breast carcinomas, uni- and multivariate analysis showed patients with high level of Survivin-3B expression had a shorter overall (P=0.030 and P=0.042 respectively), and disease-free (P=0.024 and P=0.009) survival. Our data suggest that Survivin-3B contributes to cell survival through the anti-apoptotic pathway and that its expression level could be an important factor in determining therapeutic strategies for breast carcinoma.},

Here, we combine genome-scale maps of regulatory DNA marked by DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) from 138 cell and tissue types with whole-genome sequences of 53 geographically diverse individuals in order to better delimit the patterns of regulatory variation in humans. We estimate that individuals likely harbor many more functionally important variants in regulatory DNA compared with protein-coding regions, although they are likely to have, on average, smaller effect sizes. Moreover, we demonstrate that there is significant heterogeneity in the level of functional constraint in regulatory DNA among different cell types. We also find marked variability in functional constraint among transcription factor motifs in regulatory DNA, with sequence motifs for major developmental regulators, such as HOX proteins, exhibiting levels of constraint comparable to protein-coding regions. Finally, we perform a genome-wide scan of recent positive selection and identify hundreds of novel substrates of adaptive regulatory evolution that are enriched for biologically interesting pathways such as melanogenesis and adipocytokine signaling. These data and results provide new insights into patterns of regulatory variation in individuals and populations and demonstrate that a large proportion of functionally important variation lies beyond the exome.},

Importantly, tumor drug resistance seems to be closely related to many intrinsic or acquired properties of CSCs, such as quiescence, specific morphology, DNA repair ability and overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins, drug efflux transporters and detoxifying enzymes. The specific microenvironment (niche) and hypoxic stability provide additional protection against anticancer therapy for CSCs. Thus, CSC-focused therapy is destined to form the core of any effective anticancer strategy. Nanomedicine has great potential in the development of CSC-targeting drugs, controlled drug delivery and release, and the design of novel gene-specific drugs and diagnostic modalities. This review is focused on tumor drug resistance-related properties of CSCs and describes current nanomedicine approaches, which could form the basis of novel combination therapies for eliminating metastatic and CSCs.},

Here, we describe point mutants of p27 deficient in their interaction with either cyclins (p27c-), CDKs (p27k-) or both (p27ck-), and demonstrate that each contact is critical for kinase inhibition and induction of G1 arrest. Through its intact cyclin contact, p27k- associated with active cyclin E\textendash CDK2 and, unlike wild type p27, p27c- or p27ck-, was efficiently phosphorylated by CDK2 on a conserved C-terminal CDK target site (TPKK). Retrovirally expressed p27k- was rapidly degraded through the proteasome in Rat1 cells, but was stabilized by secondary mutation of the TPKK site to VPKK. In this experimental setting, exogenous wild-type p27 formed inactive ternary complexes with cellular cyclin E\textendash CDK2, was not degraded through the proteasome, and was not further stabilized by the VPKK mutation. p27ck-, which was not recruited to cyclin E\textendash CDK2, also remained stable in vivo. Thus, selective degradation of p27k- depended upon association with active cyclin E\textendash CDK2 and subsequent phosphorylation. Altogether, these data show that p27 must be phosphorylated by CDK2 on the TPKK site in order to be degraded by the proteasome. We propose that cellular p27 must also exist transiently in a cyclin-bound non-inhibitory conformation in vivo.},

Here we analyse the human Pol II core promoter and use machine learning to generate predictive models for the downstream core promoter region (DPR) and the TATA box. We developed a method termed HARPE (high-throughput analysis of randomized promoter elements) to create hundreds of thousands of DPR (or TATA box) variants, each with known transcriptional strength. We then analysed the HARPE data by support vector regression (SVR) to provide comprehensive models for the sequence motifs, and found that the SVR-based approach is more effective than a consensus-based method for predicting transcriptional activity. These results show that the DPR is a functionally important core promoter element that is widely used in human promoters. Notably, there appears to be a duality between the DPR and the TATA box, as many promoters contain one or the other element. More broadly, these findings show that functional DNA motifs can be identified by machine learning analysis of a comprehensive set of sequence variants.},

In p190(BCR/ABL)-expressing human B-cell leukemia lines, knockdown of c-Myb expression suppressed proliferation and colony formation. Compared with c-Myb(w/f) cells, expression of Bmi1, a regulator of stem cell proliferation and maintenance, was decreased in pre-B cells from Myb(w/d) p190(BCR/ABL) transgenic mice. Ectopic expression of a mutant c-Myb or Bmi1 enhanced the proliferation and colony formation of Myb(w/d) p190(BCR/ABL) B-cells; by contrast, Bmi1 downregulation inhibited colony formation of p190(BCR/ABL)-expressing murine B cells and human B-cell leukemia lines. Moreover, c-Myb interacted with a segment of the human Bmi1 promoter and enhanced its activity. In blasts from 19 Ph(1) adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, levels of c-Myb and Bmi1 showed a positive correlation.

However, the phenotypes accessible to pooled-library screening are limited. Complex phenotypes, such as cellular morphology and subcellular molecular organization, as well as their dynamics, require imaging-based readout and are currently beyond the reach of pooled-library CRISPR screening. Here we report an all imaging-based pooled-library CRISPR screening approach that combines high-content phenotype imaging with high-throughput single guide RNA (sgRNA) identification in individual cells. In this approach, sgRNAs are codelivered to cells with corresponding barcodes placed at the 3{${'}$} untranslated region of a reporter gene using a lentiviral delivery system with reduced recombination-induced sgRNA-barcode mispairing. Multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) is used to read out the barcodes and hence identify the sgRNAs with high accuracy. We used this approach to screen 162 sgRNAs targeting 54 RNA-binding proteins for their effects on RNA localization to nuclear compartments and uncovered previously unknown regulatory factors for nuclear RNA localization. Notably, our screen revealed both positive and negative regulators for the nuclear speckle localization of a long noncoding RNA, MALAT1, suggesting a dynamic regulation of lncRNA localization in subcellular compartments.},

  abstract = {Boundary elements partition eukaryotic chromatin into active and repressive domains, and can also block regulatory interactions between domains. Boundary elements act via diverse mechanisms making accurate feature-based computational predictions difficult. Therefore, we developed an unbiased algorithm that predicts the locations of human boundary elements based on the genomic distributions of chromatin and transcriptional states, as opposed to any intrinsic characteristics that they may possess. Application of our algorithm to ChIP-seq data for histone modifications and RNA Pol II-binding data in human CD4 + T cells resulted in the prediction of 2542 putative chromatin boundary elements genome wide. Predicted boundary elements display two distinct features: first, position-specific open chromatin and histone acetylation that is coincident with the recruitment of sequence-specific DNA-binding factors such as CTCF, EVI1 and YYI, and second, a directional and gradual increase in histone lysine methylation across predicted boundaries coincident with a gain of expression of non-coding RNAs, including examples of boundaries encoded by tRNA and other non-coding RNA genes. Accordingly, a number of the predicted human boundaries may function via the synergistic action of sequence-specific recruitment of transcription factors leading to non-coding RNA transcriptional interference and the blocking of facultative heterochromatin propagation by transcription-associated chromatin remodeling complexes.},

  abstract = {Insulators are regulatory elements that help to organize eukaryotic chromatin via enhancer-blocking and chromatin barrier activity. Although there are several examples of transposable element (TE)-derived insulators, the contribution of TEs to human insulators has not been systematically explored. Mammalian-wide interspersed repeats (MIRs) are a conserved family of TEs that have substantial regulatory capacity and share sequence characteristics with tRNA-related insulators. We sought to evaluate whether MIRs can serve as insulators in the human genome. We applied a bioinformatic screen using genome sequence and functional genomic data from CD4+ T cells to identify a set of 1,178 predicted MIR insulators genome-wide. These predicted MIR insulators were computationally tested to serve as chromatin barriers and regulators of gene expression in CD4+ T cells. The activity of predicted MIR insulators was experimentally validated using in vitro and in vivo enhancer-blocking assays. MIR insulators are enriched around genes of the T-cell receptor pathway and reside at T-cell\textendash specific boundaries of repressive and active chromatin. A total of 58\% of the MIR insulators predicted here show evidence of T-cell\textendash specific chromatin barrier and gene regulatory activity. MIR insulators appear to be CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) independent and show a distinct local chromatin environment with marked peaks for RNA Pol III and a number of histone modifications, suggesting that MIR insulators recruit transcriptional complexes and chromatin modifying enzymes in situ to help establish chromatin and regulatory domains in the human genome. The provisioning of insulators by MIRs across the human genome suggests a specific mechanism by which TE sequences can be used to modulate gene regulatory networks.},

Despite the increasing adoption of these platforms, their relative potencies and mechanistic differences are incompletely characterized, particularly at human enhancer\textendash promoter pairs. Here, we systematically compared the most widely adopted dCas9-based transcriptional activators, as well as an activator consisting of dCas9 fused to the catalytic core of the human CBP protein, at human enhancer\textendash promoter pairs. We find that these platforms display variable relative expression levels in different human cell types and that their transactivation efficacies vary based upon the effector domain, effector recruitment architecture, targeted locus~and cell type. We also show that each dCas9-based activator can induce the production of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and that this eRNA induction is positively correlated with downstream mRNA expression from a cognate promoter. Additionally, we use dCas9-based activators to demonstrate that an intrinsic transcriptional and epigenetic reciprocity can exist between human enhancers and promoters and that enhancer-mediated tracking and engagement of a downstream promoter can be synthetically driven by targeting dCas9-based transcriptional activators to an enhancer. Collectively, our study provides new insights into the enhancer-mediated control of human gene expression and the use of dCas9-based activators.},

We introduce a second generation splice detection algorithm, MapSplice, whose focus is high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of splices as well as CPU and memory efficiency. MapSplice can be applied to both short ({$<$}75\,bp) and long reads ({$\geq$}75\,bp). MapSplice is not dependent on splice site features or intron length, consequently it can detect novel canonical as well as non-canonical splices. MapSplice leverages the quality and diversity of read alignments of a given splice to increase accuracy. We demonstrate that MapSplice achieves higher sensitivity and specificity than TopHat and SpliceMap on a set of simulated RNA-seq data. Experimental studies also support the accuracy of the algorithm. Splice junctions derived from eight breast cancer RNA-seq datasets recapitulated the extensiveness of alternative splicing on a global level as well as the differences between molecular subtypes of breast cancer. These combined results indicate that MapSplice is a highly accurate algorithm for the alignment of RNA-seq reads to splice junctions.

The cells show normal growth and mitosis at 33 degrees C, the permissive temperature. At the nonpermissive temperature of 39 degrees C, mitotic progression becomes aberrant. Metaphase cells and those cells still able to form a metaphase configuration continue through and complete normal cell division. However, cells exposed to 39 degrees C for longer than 15 min can not form a normal metaphase spindle. Instead, the chromosomes are distributed in a spherical shell, with microtubules (MT) radiating to the chromosomes from four closely associated centrioles near the center of the cell. The cells progress from the spherical monopolar state to other monopolar orientations conical in appearance with four centrioles in the apex region. Organized chromosome movement is present, from the spherical shell state to the asymmetrical orientations. Chromosomes remain in the metaphase configuration without chromatid separation. Prometaphase chromosome congression appears normal, as the chromosomes and MT form a stable monopolar spindle, but bipolar spindle formation is apparently blocked in a premetaphase state. When returned from 39 degrees to 33 degrees C, the defective phenotype is readily reversible. At 39 degrees C, the mitotic abnormality lasts 3-5 h, followed by reformation of a single nucleus and cell flattening in an interphase-like state. Subsequent cell cycle events appear to occur, as the cells duplicate chromosomes and initiate a second round of abnormal mitosis. Cell cycle traversion continues for at least 5 d in some cells despite abnormal mitosis resulting in cells accumulating several hundred chromosomes.},

We applied this method to sequence single normal and tumour nuclei from an oestrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer and a triple-negative ductal carcinoma. In parallel, we performed single nuclei copy number profiling. Our data show that aneuploid rearrangements occurred early in tumour evolution and remained highly stable as the tumour masses clonally expanded. In contrast, point mutations evolved gradually, generating extensive clonal diversity. Using targeted single-molecule sequencing, many of the diverse mutations were shown to occur at low frequencies ({$<$}10\%) in the tumour mass. Using mathematical modelling we found that the triple-negative tumour cells had an increased mutation rate (13.3\texttimes ), whereas the ER+ tumour cells did not. These findings have important implications for the diagnosis, therapeutic treatment and evolution of chemoresistance in breast cancer.},

To create an animal model that allows observation of exocrine cell differentiation, proliferation, and morphogenesis in living animals, we used the zebrafish elastaseA (elaA) regulatory sequence to develop transgenic zebrafish that display highly specific exocrine pancreas expression of GFP in both larvae and adult. By following GFP expression, we found that the pancreas in early development was a relatively compact organ and later extended posterior along the intestine. By transferring the elaA:gfp transgene into slow muscle omitted mutant that is deficient in receiving Hedgehog signals, we further showed that Hedgehog signaling is required for exocrine morphogenesis but not for cell differentiation. We also applied the morpholino knockdown and toxin-mediated cell ablation approaches to this transgenic line. We showed that the development of exocrine pancreas is Islet-1 dependent. Injection of the diphtheria toxin A (DTA) construct under the elastaseA promoter resulted in selective ablation of exocrine cells while the endocrine cells and other endodermal derivatives (liver and intestine) were not affected. Thus, our works demonstrated the new transgenic line provided a useful experimental tool in analyzing exocrine pancreas development.},

Actin and microtubules are coupled structurally and distributed asymmetrically along the front-rear axis of migrating cells. CLIP-associating proteins (CLASPs) accumulate near the ends of microtubules at the front of migrating cells to control microtubule dynamics and cytoskeletal coupling. Regional inhibition of GSK-3beta is responsible for this asymmetric distribution of CLASPs. However, it is not known how GSK-3beta regulates the activity of CLASPs for linkage between actin and microtubules. Here we identified IQGAP1, an actin-binding protein, as a novel CLASP-binding protein. GSK-3beta directly phosphorylates CLASP2 at Ser533 and Ser537 within the region responsible for the IQGAP1 binding. Phosphorylation of CLASP2 results in the dissociation of CLASP2 from IQGAP1, EB1 and microtubules. At the leading edges of migrating fibroblasts, CLASP2 near microtubule ends partially colocalises with IQGAP1. Expression of active GSK-3beta abrogates the distribution of CLASP2 on microtubules, but not that of a nonphosphorylatable CLASP2 mutant. The phosphorylated CLASP2 does not accumulate near the ends of microtubules at the leading edges. Thus, phosphorylation of CLASP2 by GSK-3beta appears to control the regional linkage of microtubules to actin filaments through IQGAP1 for cell migration.},

  abstract = {Back to TopAbstract We have discovered several novel features exhibited by microtubules (MTs) in migrating newt lung epithelial cells by time-lapse imaging of fluorescently labeled, microinjected tubulin. These cells exhibit leading edge ruffling and retrograde flow in the lamella and lamellipodia. The plus ends of lamella MTs persist in growth perpendicular to the leading edge until they reach the base of the lamellipodium, where they oscillate between short phases of growth and shortening. Occasionally ``pioneering'' MTs grow into the lamellipodium, where microtubule bending and reorientation parallel to the leading edge is associated with retrograde flow. MTs parallel to the leading edge exhibit significantly different dynamics from MTs perpendicular to the cell edge. Both parallel MTs and photoactivated fluorescent marks on perpendicular MTs move rearward at the 0.4 {$\mu$}m/min rate of retrograde flow in the lamella. MT rearward transport persists when MT dynamic instability is inhibited by 100-nM nocodazole but is blocked by inhibition of actomyosin by cytochalasin D or 2,3-butanedione\textendash 2-monoxime. Rearward flow appears to cause MT buckling and breaking in the lamella. 80\% of free minus ends produced by breakage are stable; the others shorten and pause, leading to MT treadmilling. Free minus ends of unknown origin also depolymerize into the field of view at the lamella. Analysis of MT dynamics at the centrosome shows that these minus ends do not arise by centrosomal ejection and that {$\sim$}80\% of the MTs in the lamella are not centrosome bound. We propose that actomyosin-based retrograde flow of MTs causes MT breakage, forming quasi-stable noncentrosomal MTs whose turnover is regulated primarily at their minus ends.},

Here we show that the growth of microtubules induced in fibroblasts by removal of the microtubule destabilizer nocodazole activates Rac1 GTPase, leading to the polymerization of actin in lamellipodial protrusions. Lamellipodial protrusions are also activated by the rapid growth of a disorganized array of very short microtubules induced by the microtubule-stabilizing drug taxol. Thus, neither microtubule shortening nor long-range microtubule-based intracellular transport is required for activating protrusion. We suggest that the growth phase of microtubule dynamic instability at leading-edge lamellipodia locally activates Rac1 to drive actin polymerization and lamellipodial protrusion required for cell migration.},

These two promoters differ in the sequences of their 'TATA boxes': for the myoglobin gene, the sequence is TATAAAA, whereas for SV40, the sequence is TATTTAT. We have now tested the hypothesis that this sequence difference is responsible for the differential response of the promoters to the MSE. We found that when the TATA box sequence of the myoglobin promoter was changed to that of the SV40 promoter, responsiveness to the MSE was abolished; conversely, when the SV40 TATA box sequence was changed to that of the myoglobin promoter, the promoter became responsive to the MSE. We conclude that mammalian TATA-box elements are functionally heterogeneous, and suggest that this heterogeneity reflects differential interactions with distinctive TATA box-binding factors, only some of which can act cooperatively with MSE-binding proteins to generate an active transcriptional complex.},

  abstract = {A two-hybrid screening in yeast for proteins interacting with the human hnRNP A1, yielded a nuclear protein of 917 amino acids that we termed hnRNP A1 associated protein (HAP). HAP contains an RNA binding domain (RBD) flanked by a negatively charged domain and by an S/K-R/E-rich region. In in vitro pull-down assays, HAP interacts with hnRNP A1, through its S/K-R/E-rich region, and with several other hnRNPs. HAP was found to be identical to the previously described Scaffold Attachment Factor B (SAF-B) and to HET, a transcriptional regulator of the Heat Shock Protein 27 gene. We show that HAP is a bona fide hnRNP protein, since anti-HAP antibodies immunoprecipitate from HeLa cell nucleoplasm the complete set of hnRNP proteins. Unlike most hnRNP proteins, the subnuclear distribution of HAP is profoundly modified in heat-shocked HeLa cells. Heat-shock treatment at 42 degrees C causes a transcription-dependent recruitment of HAP to a few large nuclear granules that exactly coincide with sites of accumulation of Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1). The recruitment of HAP to the granules is temporally delayed with respect to HSF1 and persists for a longer time during recovery at 37 degrees C. The hnRNP complexes immunoprecipitated from nucleoplasm of heat-shocked cells with anti-HAP antibodies have an altered protein composition with respect to canonical complexes. Altogether our results suggest an involvement of HAP in the cellular response to heat shock, possibly at the RNA metabolism level.},

We present an extensive experimental/computational study of an HIV-1 model vector (LTR-GFP-IRES-Tat) and show that stochastic fluctuations in Tat influence the viral latency decision. Low GFP/Tat expression was found to generate bifurcating phenotypes with clonal populations derived from single proviral integrations simultaneously exhibiting very high and near zero GFP expression. Although phenotypic bifurcation (PheB) was correlated with distinct genomic integration patterns, neither these patterns nor other extrinsic cellular factors (cell cycle/size, aneuploidy, chromatin silencing, etc.) explained PheB. Stochastic computational modeling successfully accounted for PheB and correctly predicted the dynamics of a Tat mutant that were subsequently confirmed by experiment. Thus, Tat stochastics appear sufficient to generate PheB (and potentially proviral latency), illustrating the importance of stochastic fluctuations in gene expression in a mammalian system.},

In the wild-type embryo, MyoD expression first occurs in an early phase, extending from mid-gastrula to just prior to somite formation, in which cells directly adjacent to the axial mesoderm express the gene. In subsequent phases, during the anterior-to-posterior wave of somite formation and maturation, expression occurs within particular regions of each somite. In spt embryos, which lack normal paraxial mesoderm due to incorrect cell migration, early MyoD expression is not observed and transcripts are instead first detected in small groups of trunk cells that will develop into aberrant myotomal-like structures. In ntl embryos, which lack notochords and tails, the early phase of MyoD expression is also absent. However, the later phase of expression within the developing somites appears to occur at the normal time in the ntl mutants, indicating that the presomitogenesis and somitogenesis phases of MyoD expression can be uncoupled. In addition, we demonstrate that the entire paraxial mesoderm of wild-type embryos has the potential to express MyoD when Sonic hedgehog is expressed ubiquitously in the embryo, and that this potential is lost in some of the cells of the paraxial mesoderm lineage in no tail and spadetail embryos. We also show that MyoD expression precedes myogenin expression and follows or is coincident with expression of snaill in some regions that express this gene.},

Here, we show that the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) contributes to enhancer-promoter structural interactions in a manner analogous to DNA interactions mediated by CTCF. YY1 binds to active enhancers and promoter-proximal elements and forms dimers that facilitate the interaction of these DNA elements. Deletion of YY1 binding sites or depletion of YY1 protein disrupts enhancer-promoter looping and gene expression. We propose that YY1-mediated enhancer-promoter interactions are a general feature of mammalian gene control.},

Cohesin enables CTCF to insulate promoters from distant enhancers and controls transcription at the H19/IGF2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) locus.

TGF-{$\beta$} normally exerts anticancer activities by prohibiting cell proliferation, and by creating cell microenvironments that inhibit cell motility, invasion and metastasis. However, accumulating evidence indicates the process of tumorigenesis, particularly that associated with metastatic progression, confers TGF-{$\beta$} with oncogenic activities, a functional switch known as the ``TGF-{$\beta$} Paradox.'' The molecular determinants governing the ``TGF-{$\beta$} Paradox'' are complex and represent an intense area of investigation by researchers in academic and industrial settings. Recent findings link genetic and epigenetic events in mediating the acquisition of oncogenic activity by TGF-{$\beta$}, as does aberrant alterations within tumor microenvironments. These events coalesce to enable TGF-{$\beta$} to direct metastatic progression via the stimulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which permits carcinoma cells to abandon polarized epithelial phenotypes in favor of apolar mesenchymal-like phenotypes. Attempts to deconstruct the EMT process induced by TGF-{$\beta$} have identified numerous signaling molecules, transcription factors, and microRNAs operant in mediating the initiation and resolution of this complex transdifferentiation event. Besides its ability to enhance carcinoma cell invasion and metastasis, EMT also engenders transitioned cells with stem-like properties, including the acquisition of self-renewal and tumor-initiating capabilities coupled to chemoresistance. Here we review recent findings that delineate the pathophysiological mechanisms whereby EMT stimulated by TGF-{$\beta$} promotes metastatic progression and disease recurrence in human carcinomas.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Mammary tumorigenesis is associated with the increased expression of several proteins in the focal adhesion complex, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and various integrins. Aberrant expression of these molecules occurs concomitant with the conversion of TGF-beta function from a tumor suppressor to a tumor promoter. We previously showed that interaction between beta3 integrin and TbetaR-II facilitates TGF-beta-mediated oncogenic signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the focal adhesion complex contributes to beta3 integrin:TbetaR-II signaling and the oncogenic conversion of TGF-beta remain poorly understood. METHODS: FAK expression and activity were inhibited in normal and malignant mammary epithelial cells (MECs) either genetically by using lentiviral-mediated delivery of shRNAs against FAK, or pharmacologically through in vitro and in vivo use of the FAK inhibitors, PF-562271 and PF-573228. Altered Smad2/3 and p38 MAPK activation, migration, EMT, and invasion in response to TGF-beta1 were monitored in FAK-manipulated cells. TbetaR-II expression was increased in metastatic breast cancer cells by retroviral transduction, and the metastasis of FAK- and TbetaR-II-manipulated tumors was monitored by using bioluminescent imaging. RESULTS: TGF-beta stimulation of MECs stabilized and activated FAK in a beta3 integrin- and Src-dependent manner. Furthermore, by using the human MCF10A breast cancer progression model, we showed that increased FAK expression in metastatic breast cancer cells mirrored the acquisition of enhanced activation of p38 MAPK by TGF-beta. Administering FAK inhibitors or rendering metastatic breast cancer cells FAK deficient abrogated the interaction between beta3 integrin and TbetaR-II, thereby preventing TGF-beta from (a) activating p38 MAPK; (b) stimulating MEC invasion, migration, and EMT; and (c) inducing early primary tumor dissemination to the lungs. Finally, in contrast to FAK depletion, adjuvant FAK chemotherapy of mammary tumors decreased their growth in part by diminished macrophage tumor infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies identify an essential function for FAK in mediating the interaction between beta3 integrin and TbetaR-II, and thus in facilitating the oncogenic conversion of TGF-beta required for mammary tumor metastasis. Furthermore, this study establishes chemotherapeutic targeting of FAK as an effective, two-pronged approach in preventing tumor progression both by decreasing innate immune cell infiltration, and by inhibiting early TGF-beta-dependent metastasis.},

We investigated whether mammalian EB1 and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) function downstream of Rho\textendash mDia in microtubule stabilization. A carboxy-terminal APC-binding fragment of EB1 (EB1-C) functioned as a dominant-negative inhibitor of microtubule stabilization induced by LPA or active mDia. Knockdown of EB1 with small interfering RNAs also prevented microtubule stabilization. Expression of either full-length EB1 or APC, but not an APC-binding mutant of EB1, was sufficient to stabilize microtubules. Binding and localization studies showed that EB1, APC and mDia may form a complex at stable microtubule ends. Furthermore, EB1-C, but not an APC-binding mutant, inhibited fibroblast migration in an in vitro wounding assay. These results show an evolutionarily conserved pathway for microtubule capture, and suggest that mDia functions as a scaffold protein for EB1 and APC to stabilize microtubules and promote cell migration.},

The fly retina contains two types of ommatidia, called `pale' and `yellow', defined by different rhodopsin pairs expressed in R7 and R8 cells. Similar to the human cone photoreceptors, these ommatidial subtypes are distributed stochastically in the retina. The choice between pale versus yellow ommatidia is made in R7 cells, which then impose their fate onto R8. Here we report that the Drosophila dioxin receptor Spineless is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of the ommatidial mosaic. A short burst of spineless expression at mid-pupation in a large subset of R7 cells precedes rhodopsin expression. In spineless mutants, all R7 and most R8 cells adopt the pale fate, whereas overexpression of spineless is sufficient to induce the yellow R7 fate. Therefore, this study suggests that the entire retinal mosaic required for colour vision is defined by the stochastic expression of a single transcription factor, Spineless.},

USF1 is present in complexes with histone modifying enzymes in cell extracts, and these enzymes specifically interact with the endogenous 5{${'}$}HS4 element. Knockdown of USF1 expression leads to a loss of histone modification recruitment and subsequent encroachment of H3K9 methylation.

We show that NEAT1 and MALAT1 localize to hundreds of genomic sites in human cells, primarily over active genes. NEAT1 and MALAT1 exhibit colocalization to many of these loci, but display distinct gene body binding patterns at these sites, suggesting independent but complementary functions for these RNAs. We also identified~numerous proteins enriched by both lncRNAs, supporting complementary binding and function, in addition to unique associated proteins. Transcriptional inhibition or stimulation alters localization of NEAT1 on active chromatin sites, implying that underlying DNA sequence does not target NEAT1 to chromatin, and that localization responds to cues involved in the transcription process.},

We have investigated podoplanin function in cultured human breast cancer cells, in a mouse model of pancreatic {$\beta$} cell carcinogenesis, and in human cancer biopsies. Our results indicate that podoplanin promotes tumor cell invasion in vitro and in vivo. Notably, the expression and subcellular localization of epithelial markers are unaltered, and mesenchymal markers are not induced in invasive podoplanin-expressing tumor cells. Rather, podoplanin induces collective cell migration by filopodia formation via the downregulation of the activities of small Rho family GTPases. In conclusion, podoplanin induces an alternative pathway of tumor cell invasion in the absence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).},

Signalling downstream of the small GTPase Rho increases contractility through Rho-kinase (ROCK)-mediated regulation of myosin-II light chain (MLC2) phosphorylation. Cdc42 signalling has been shown to control cell polarity. Tumour cells can move through a three-dimensional matrix with either a rounded morphology characterized by Rho\textendash ROCK dependence or with an elongated morphology characterized by Rho\textendash ROCK independence. Here we show that contractility necessary for elongated morphology and invasion can be generated by Cdc42\textendash MRCK signalling. MRCK (myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinase) cooperates with ROCK in the maintenance of elongated morphology and invasion and either MRCK or ROCK is sufficient for MLC2 phosphorylation, through the inhibitory phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase. By contrast, in rounded ROCK-dependent movement, where MLC2 phosphorylation is higher, MRCK has a smaller role. Our data show that a Cdc42\textendash MRCK signal mediates myosin-dependent cell motility and highlight convergence between Rho and Cdc42 signalling.},

In vitro studies indicate that their association with chromatin determines nucleosome spacing and enables arrays of nucleosomes to fold into more compact chromatin structures. However, the in vivo roles of H1 are poorly understood2. Here we show that the local density of H1 controls the balance of repressive and active chromatin domains by promoting genomic compaction. We generated a conditional triple-H1-knockout mouse strain and depleted H1 in haematopoietic cells. H1 depletion in T cells leads to de-repression of T cell activation genes, a process that mimics normal T cell activation. Comparison of chromatin structure in normal and H1-depleted CD8+ T cells reveals that H1-mediated chromatin compaction occurs primarily in regions of the genome containing higher than average levels of H1: the chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) B compartment and regions of the Hi-C A compartment marked by PRC2. Reduction of H1 stoichiometry leads to decreased H3K27 methylation, increased H3K36 methylation, B-to-A-compartment shifting and an increase in interaction frequency between compartments. In vitro, H1 promotes PRC2-mediated H3K27 methylation and inhibits NSD2-mediated H3K36 methylation. Mechanistically, H1 mediates these opposite effects by promoting physical compaction of the chromatin substrate. Our results establish H1 as a critical regulator of gene silencing through localized control of chromatin compaction, 3D genome organization and the epigenetic landscape.},

These studies reveal that NC2 (Dr1-Drap1) is a bifunctional basal transcription factor that differentially regulates gene transcription through DPE or TATA box motifs.},

  abstract = {Most of the eukaryotic genome is transcribed, yielding a complex network of transcripts that includes tens of thousands of long noncoding RNAs with little or no protein-coding capacity. Although the vast majority of long noncoding RNAs have yet to be characterized thoroughly, many of these transcripts are unlikely to represent transcriptional ``noise'' as a significant number have been shown to exhibit cell type-specific expression, localization to subcellular compartments, and association with human diseases. Here, we highlight recent efforts that have identified a myriad of molecular functions for long noncoding RNAs. In some cases, it appears that simply the act of noncoding RNA transcription is sufficient to positively or negatively affect the expression of nearby genes. However, in many cases, the long noncoding RNAs themselves serve key regulatory roles that were assumed previously to be reserved for proteins, such as regulating the activity or localization of proteins and serving as organizational frameworks of subcellular structures. In addition, many long noncoding RNAs are processed to yield small RNAs or, conversely, modulate how other RNAs are processed. It is thus becoming increasingly clear that long noncoding RNAs can function via numerous paradigms and are key regulatory molecules in the cell.},

The dynamic organization of the actin cytoskeleton provides the force for cell motility and is regulated by small GTPases of the Rho family, in particular Rac1, RhoA and Cdc42. Although the microtubule cytoskeleton is also polarized in a migrating cell, and microtubules are essential for the directed migration of many cell types, their role in cell motility is not well understood at a molecular level. Here, we discuss the potential molecular mechanisms for interplay of microtubules, actin and Rho GTPase signalling in cell polarization and motility. Recent evidence suggests that microtubules locally modulate the activity of Rho GTPases and, conversely, Rho GTPases might be responsible for the initial polarization of the microtubule cytoskeleton. Thus, microtubules might be part of a positive feedback mechanism that maintains the stable polarization of a directionally migrating cell.},

Lettuce exhibited high levels of transient expression and was at least as easy to work with as Nicotiana benthamiana. Transient expression occurred in the majority of cells within the infiltrated tissue and approached 100\% in some regions. High levels of transient expression were obtained in some ecotypes of Arabidopsis; however, Arabidopsis remains recalcitrant to routine, genotype-independent transient assays. Transient expression levels often exceeded those observed in stably transformed plants. The laboratory Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 was the best strain for use in plant species that did not elicit a necrotic response to A. tumefaciens. A wild A. tumefaciens strain, 1D1246, was identified that provided high levels of transient expression in solanaceous plants without background necrosis, enabling routine transient assays in these species.},

Using affinity purification coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, we identified Sall4 as a Nanog co-purified protein. Co-immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments confirmed the interaction between Nanog and Sall4. We showed that Nanog and Sall4 co-occupied Nanog and Sall4 enhancer regions in living ES cells. Knockdown of Nanog or Sall4 by RNA interference led to a reduction in Nanog and Sall4 enhancer activities, providing evidence that these factors are positively regulating these enhancers. Importantly, co-transfection of Sall4 with these ES cell-specific enhancers led to transactivation in heterologous somatic cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments also showed that Sall4 co-occupied many Nanog binding sites in ES cells. Our data implicate Sall4 as an important component of the transcription regulatory networks in ES cells by cooperating with Nanog. We suggest that Sall4 and Nanog form a regulatory circuit similar to that of Oct4 and Sox2.

  abstract = {The inherent stochasticity generates substantial gene expression variation among isogenic cells under identical conditions, which is frequently referred to as gene expression noise or cell-to-cell expression variability. Similar to (average) expression level, expression noise is also subject to natural selection. Yet it has been observed that noise is negatively correlated with expression level, which manifests as a potential constraint for simultaneous optimization of both. Here, we studied expression noise in human embryonic cells with computational analysis on single-cell RNA-seq data and in yeast with flow cytometry experiments. We showed that this coupling is overcome, to a certain degree, by a histone modification strategy in multiple embryonic developmental stages in human, as well as in yeast. Importantly, this epigenetic strategy could fit into a burst-like gene expression model: promoter-localized histone modifications (such as H3K4 methylation) are associated with both burst size and burst frequency, which together influence expression level, while gene-body-localized ones (such as H3K79 methylation) are more associated with burst frequency, which influences both expression level and noise. We further knocked out the only ``writer'' of H3K79 methylation in yeast, and observed that expression noise is indeed increased. Consistently, dosage sensitive genes, such as genes in the Wnt signaling pathway, tend to be marked with gene-body-localized histone modifications, while stress responding genes, such as genes regulating autophagy, tend to be marked with promoter-localized ones. Our findings elucidate that the ``division of labor'' among histone modifications facilitates the independent regulation of expression level and noise, extend the ``histone code'' hypothesis to include expression noise, and shed light on the optimization of transcriptome in evolution., Gene expression noise, or cell-to-cell expression variability, has been a topic of intense interest for more than a decade. The prevailing model of ``burst-like transcription'' mediated by the promoter transitions between on and off states explains the formation of noise in eukaryotes. Albeit widely accepted, the cis- elements that determine the burst frequency and burst size remain largely unknown. Here we systematically examined the relationship between transcriptional burst frequency/size and all major histone modifications in various cell types, including human embryonic cells, mouse embryonic stem cells, and yeast, and found that histone markers can be divided into two groups based on their associations with burst frequency/ size. Coincidently, promoter-localized histone markers are associated with both burst size and burst frequency whereas gene-body-localized ones are more associated with burst frequency. We further knocked out a gene that is responsible for ``writing'' a gene-body histone mark in yeast, and found that burst frequency is indeed reduced. Our findings reveal a new mechanism of transcriptional burst regulation and shed light on the simultaneous optimization of gene expression level and noise in evolution.},

  abstract = {Animal genomes are organized into topologically associated domains (TADs). TADs are thought to contribute to gene regulation by facilitating enhancer-promoter (E-P) contacts within a TAD preventing these contacts across TAD borders. However, the absolute difference in contact frequency across TAD boundaries is usually less than two-fold, even though disruptions of TAD borders can change gene expression by ten-fold. Existing models fail to explain this hypersensitive response. Here, we propose a futile cycle model of enhancer-mediated regulation that can exhibit hypersensitivity through bistability and hysteresis. Consistent with recent experiments, this regulation does not exhibit strong correlation between enhancer-promoter contact and promoter activity, even though regulation occurs through contact. Through mathematical analysis and stochastic simulation, we show that this system can create an illusion of enhancer-promoter biochemical specificity and explain the importance of weak TAD boundaries. It also offers a mechanism to reconcile apparently contradictory results from recent global TAD disruption with local TAD boundary deletion experiments. Together, these analyses advance our understanding of cis-regulatory contacts in controlling gene expression, and suggest new experimental directions.},

  abstract = {Transcription factor (TF)-directed enhanceosome assembly constitutes a fundamental regulatory mechanism driving spatiotemporal gene expression programs during animal development. Despite decades of study, we know little about the dynamics or order of events animating TF assembly at cis-regulatory elements in living cells and the long-range molecular ``dialog'' between enhancers and promoters. Here, combining genetic, genomic, and imaging approaches, we characterize a complex long-range enhancer cluster governing Kr\"uppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) expression in na\"ive pluripotency. Genome editing by CRISPR/Cas9 revealed that OCT4 and SOX2 safeguard an accessible chromatin neighborhood to assist the binding of other TFs/cofactors to the enhancer. Single-molecule live-cell imaging uncovered that two na\"ive pluripotency TFs, STAT3 and ESRRB, interrogate chromatin in a highly dynamic manner, in which SOX2 promotes ESRRB target search and chromatin-binding dynamics through a direct protein-tethering mechanism. Together, our results support a highly dynamic yet intrinsically ordered enhanceosome assembly to maintain the finely balanced transcription program underlying na\"ive pluripotency.},

Although speckles contain little detectable transcriptional activity, they are found preferentially associated with specific mRNA-coding genes and gene-rich R bands, and they accumulate some unspliced pre-mRNAs. RNA polymerase II transcribes mRNAs and is required for splicing, with some reports suggesting that the inactive complexes are stored in splicing speckles. Using ultrathin cryosections to improve optical resolution and preserve nuclear structure, we find that all forms of polymerase II are present, but not enriched, within speckles. Inhibition of polymerase activity shows that speckles do not act as major storage sites for inactive polymerase II complexes but that they contain a stable pool of polymerase II phosphorylated on serine2 residues of the C-terminal domain, which is transcriptionally inactive and may have roles in spliceosome assembly or posttranscriptional splicing of pre-mRNAs. Paraspeckle domains lie adjacent to speckles, but little is known about their protein content or putative roles in the expression of the speckle-associated genes. We find that paraspeckles are transcriptionally inactive but contain polymerase II, which remains stably associated upon transcriptional inhibition, when paraspeckles reorganize around nucleoli in the form of caps.},

This observation has been partly attributed to changes in chromatin accessibility and histone modification (HM) patterns surrounding BSs. Previous studies focusing on BSs within DNA regulatory regions found correlations between HM patterns and TF binding specificities. However, a mechanistic understanding of TF\textendash DNA binding specificity determinants is still not available. The ability to predict in vivo TF binding on a genome-wide scale requires the identification of features that determine TF binding based on evolutionary relationships of DNA binding proteins. To reveal protein family\textendash dependent mechanisms of TF binding, we conducted comprehensive comparisons of HM patterns surrounding BSs and non-BSs with exactly matched core motifs for TFs in three cell lines: 33 TFs in GM12878, 37 TFs in K562, and 18 TFs in H1-hESC. These TFs displayed protein family\textendash specific preferences for HM patterns surrounding BSs, with high agreement among cell lines. Moreover, compared to models based on DNA sequence and shape at flanking regions of BSs, HM-augmented quantitative machine-learning methods resulted in increased performance in a TF family\textendash specific manner. Analysis of the relative importance of features in these models indicated that TFs, displaying larger HM pattern differences between BSs and non-BSs, bound DNA in an HM-specific manner on a protein family\textendash specific basis. We propose that TF family\textendash specific HM preferences reveal distinct mechanisms that assist in guiding TFs to their cognate BSs by altering chromatin structure and accessibility.},

Sall4 also interacts with Baf60a, a member of the SWI/SNF (switch/sucrose nonfermentable) ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex, which is responsible for recruiting Sall4 to the site of DNA DSB damage. Our findings provide novel mechanisms to coordinate stemness of ESCs with DNA damage response, ensuring genomic stability during the expansion of ESCs.},

We developed GSAASeqSP, a novel toolset for genome-wide gene set association analysis of sequence count data. This toolset offers a variety of statistical procedures via combinations of multiple gene-level and gene set-level statistics, each having their own strengths under different sample and experimental conditions. These methods can be employed independently, or results generated from multiple or all methods can be integrated to determine more robust profiles of significantly altered biological pathways. Using simulations, we demonstrate the ability of these methods to identify association signals and to measure the strength of the association. We show that GSAASeqSP analyses of RNA-Seq data from diverse tissue samples provide meaningful insights into the biological mechanisms that differentiate these samples. GSAASeqSP is a powerful platform for investigating molecular underpinnings of complex traits and diseases arising from differential activity within the biological pathways.

  abstract = {During development and in the context of different morphogenetic events, epithelial cells undergo a process called epithelial to mesenchymal transition or transdifferentiation (EMT). In this process, the cells lose their epithelial characteristics, including their polarity and specialized cell-cell contacts, and acquire a migratory behavior, allowing them to move away from their epithelial cell community and to integrate into surrounding tissue, even at remote locations. EMT illustrates the differentiation plasticity during development and is complemented by another process, called mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). While being an integral process during development, EMT is also recapitulated under pathological conditions, prominently in fibrosis and in invasion and metastasis of carcinomas. Accordingly, EMT is considered as an important step in tumor progression. TGF- signaling has been shown to play an important role in EMT. In fact, adding TGF- to epithelial cells in culture is a convenient way to induce EMT in various epithelial cells. Although much less characterized, epithelial plasticity can also be regulated by TGF--related bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), and BMPs have been shown to induce EMT or MET depending on the developmental context. In this review, we will discuss the induction of EMT in response to TGF-, and focus on the underlying signaling and transcription mechanisms.},

Core promoters are diverse and may contain a variety of sequence elements such as the TATA box, the Initiator (INR), and the downstream promoter element (DPE) recognized, respectively, by the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factors of the TFIID complex. Core promoter elements contribute to the gene selectivity of enhancers, and INR/DPE-specific enhancers and activators have been identified. Here, we identify a TATA box-selective activating sequence upstream of the human {$\beta$}-actin (ACTB) gene that mediates serum response factor (SRF)-induced transcription from TATA-dependent but not INR-dependent promoters and requires the TATA-binding/bending activity of TBP, which is otherwise dispensable for transcription from a TATA-less promoter. The SRF-dependent ACTB sequence is stereospecific on TATA promoters but activates in an orientation-independent manner a composite TATA/INR-containing promoter. More generally, we show that SRF-regulated genes of the actin/cytoskeleton/contractile family tend to have a TATA box. These results suggest distinct TATA-dependent and INR-dependent mechanisms of TFIID-mediated transcription in mammalian cells that are compatible with only certain stereospecific combinations of activators, and that a TBP-TATA binding mechanism is important for SRF activation of the actin/cytoskeleton-related gene family.},

Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-BP) is an allosteric activator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1), a rate-limiting enzyme and essential control point in glycolysis. The concentration of Fru-2,6-BP in mammalian cells is set by four 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatases (PFKFB1\textendash 4), which interconvert fructose 6-phosphate and Fru-2,6-BP. The relative functions of the PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 enzymes are of particular interest because they are activated in human cancers and increased by mitogens and low oxygen. We examined the cellular localization of PFKFB3 and PFKFB4 and unexpectedly found that whereas PFKFB4 localized to the cytoplasm (i.e. the site of glycolysis), PFKFB3 localized to the nucleus. We then overexpressed PFKFB3 and observed no change in glucose metabolism but rather a marked increase in cell proliferation. These effects on proliferation were completely abrogated by mutating either the active site or nuclear localization residues of PFKFB3, demonstrating a requirement for nuclear delivery of Fru-2,6-BP. Using protein array analyses, we then found that ectopic expression of PFKFB3 increased the expression of several key cell cycle proteins, including cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-1, Cdc25C, and cyclin D3 and decreased the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27, a universal inhibitor of Cdk-1 and the cell cycle. We also observed that the addition of Fru-2,6-BP to HeLa cell lysates increased the phosphorylation of the Cdk-specific Thr-187 site of p27. Taken together, these observations demonstrate an unexpected role for PFKFB3 in nuclear signaling and indicate that Fru-2,6-BP may couple the activation of glucose metabolism with cell proliferation.},

AvrXa7, the product of avrXa7, is also a virulence factor in strain PXO86 of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. Avirulence and virulence specificities are associated with the central repeat domain, which, in avrXa7, consists of 25.5 direct repeat units. Mutations in three C-terminal nuclear localization signal motifs eliminated avirulence and virulence activities in rice and severely reduced nuclear localization in a yeast assay system. Both pathogenicity functions and nuclear localization were restored on the addition of the sequence for the nuclear localization signal motif from SV40 T-antigen. The loss of avirulence activity because of mutations in the acidic transcriptional activation domain was restored by addition of the activation domain from the herpes simplex viral protein VP16. The activation domain was also required for virulence activity. However, the VP16 domain could not substitute for the endogenous domain in virulence assays. In gel shift assays, AvrXa7 bound double-stranded DNA with a preference for dA/dT rich sequences. The results indicate that products of the avrBs3-related genes are virulence factors targeted to host cell nuclei and have the potential to interact with the host DNA and transcriptional machinery as part of their mode of action.

The fraction of human and yeast genes that contain specific core promoter elements such as the TATA box and the initiator (INR) remains unclear and core promoter motifs specific for TATA-less genes remain to be identified. Here, we present genome-scale computational analyses indicating that approximately 76\% of human core promoters lack TATA-like elements, have a high GC content, and are enriched in Sp1-binding sites. We further identify two motifs - M3 (SCGGAAGY) and M22 (TGCGCANK) - that occur preferentially in human TATA-less core promoters. About 24\% of human genes have a TATA-like element and their promoters are generally AT-rich; however, only approximately 10\% of these TATA-containing promoters have the canonical TATA box (TATAWAWR). In contrast, approximately 46\% of human core promoters contain the consensus INR (YYANWYY) and approximately 30\% are INR-containing TATA-less genes. Significantly, approximately 46\% of human promoters lack both TATA-like and consensus INR elements. Surprisingly, mammalian-type INR sequences are present - and tend to cluster - in the transcription start site (TSS) region of approximately 40\% of yeast core promoters and the frequency of specific core promoter types appears to be conserved in yeast and human genomes. Gene Ontology analyses reveal that TATA-less genes in humans, as in yeast, are frequently involved in basic "housekeeping" processes, while TATA-containing genes are more often highly regulated, such as by biotic or stress stimuli. These results reveal unexpected similarities in the occurrence of specific core promoter types and in their associated biological processes in yeast and humans and point to novel vertebrate-specific DNA motifs that might play a selective role in TATA-independent transcription.},

A significant fraction of SALL4B was further modified by sumoylation when it was expressed in HEK293T cells. Constitutive SUMO-modification of SALL4B was also detected in Tera-1, a cell line of the teratocarcinoma origin. SALL4B sumoylation was independent of ubiquitination and lysine residues 156, 316, 374, and 401 were essential for sumoylation. Chromatin fraction contained more SUMO-deficient SALL4B. Despite a shorter half-life than the wild-type counterpart, SUMO-deficient SALL4B interacted with OCT4 more efficiently than the wild-type SALL4B. RNAi-mediated silencing of SALL4 expression caused significant down-regulation of both OCT4 and SOX2, which was rescued by ectopic expression of SALL4B but not by SUMO-deficient mutant. Significantly, compared with the wild-type SALL4B, SUMO-deficient mutant exhibited compromised trans-activation or trans-repression activities in reporter gene assays. Combined, our studies reveal sumoylation as a novel form of post-translational modification for regulating the stability, subcellular localization, and transcriptional activity of SALL4.},

  abstract = {Bmi-1 and SALL4 are putative oncogenes that modulate stem cell pluripotency and play a role in leukemogenesis. Murine Sall4 also has been shown to play an essential role in maintaining the properties of ES cells and governing the fate of the primitive inner cell mass. Here, we demonstrate that transcription from the Bmi-1 promoter is strikingly activated by SALL4 in a dose-dependent manner by using a luciferase reporter gene assay. Both promoter deletion construct studies and ChIP from a myeloid stem cell line, 32D, demonstrate that SALL4 binds to a specific region of the Bmi-1 promoter. Deletion of one copy of Sall4 by gene targeting in mouse bone marrow significantly reduced Bmi-1 expression. Reducing SALL4 expression by siRNA in the HL-60 leukemia cell line also results in significant down-regulation of Bmi-1. Furthermore, Bmi-1 expression is up-regulated in transgenic mice that constitutively overexpress human SALL4, and the levels of Bmi-1 in these mice increase as they progress from normal to preleukemic (myelodysplastic syndrome) and leukemic (acute myeloid leukemia) stages. High levels of H3\textendash K4 trimethylation and H3\textendash K79 dimethylation were observed in the SALL4 binding region of the Bmi-1 promoter. These findings suggest a novel link between SALL4 and Bmi-1 in regulating self-renewal of normal and leukemic stem cells. An increase in histone H3\textendash K4 and H3\textendash K79 methylation within the Bmi-1 promoter provides an epigenetic mechanism for histone modifications in SALL4-mediated Bmi-1 gene deregulation.},

  abstract = {Embryonic stem cells have potential utility in regenerative medicine because of their pluripotent characteristics. Sall4, a zinc-finger transcription factor, is expressed very early in embryonic development with Oct4 and Nanog, two well-characterized pluripotency regulators. Sall4 plays an important role in governing the fate of stem cells through transcriptional regulation of both Oct4 and Nanog. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to microarray hybridization (ChIP-on-chip), we have mapped global gene targets of Sall4 to further investigate regulatory processes in W4 mouse ES cells. A total of 3,223 genes were identified that were bound by the Sall4 protein on duplicate assays with high confidence, and many of these have major functions in developmental and regulatory pathways. Sall4 bound approximately twice as many annotated genes within promoter regions as Nanog and approximately four times as many as Oct4. Immunoprecipitation revealed a heteromeric protein complex(es) between Sall4, Oct4, and Nanog, consistent with binding site co-occupancies. Decreasing Sall4 expression in W4 ES cells decreases the expression levels of Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4, four proteins capable of reprogramming somatic cells to an induced pluripotent state. Further, Sall4 bound many genes that are regulated in part by chromatin-based epigenetic events mediated by polycomb-repressive complexes and bivalent domains. This suggests that Sall4 plays a diverse role in regulating stem cell pluripotency during early embryonic development through integration of transcriptional and epigenetic controls.},

  abstract = {Summary Although eukaryotic nuclei contain distinct architectural structures associated with noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), their potential relationship to regulated transcriptional programs remains poorly understood. Here, we report that methylation/demethylation of Polycomb 2 protein (Pc2) controls relocation of growth-control genes between Polycomb bodies (PcGs) and interchromatin granules (ICGs) in response to growth signals. This movement is the consequence of binding of methylated and unmethylated Pc2 to the ncRNAs TUG1 and MALAT1/NEAT2, located in PcGs and ICGs, respectively. These ncRNAs mediate assembly of multiple corepressors/coactivators and can serve to switch mark recognition by ``readers'' of the histone code. Additionally, binding of NEAT2 to unmethylated Pc2 promotes E2F1 SUMOylation, leading to activation of the growth-control gene program. These observations delineate a molecular pathway linking the actions of subnuclear structure-specific ncRNAs and nonhistone protein methylation to relocation of transcription units in the three-dimensional space of the nucleus, thus achieving coordinated gene expression programs.

Currently, the exact mechanisms that connect distal enhancers to their specific target promoters remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we show that the enhancer-specific histone H3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) and the histone methyltransferases MLL3 and MLL4 (MLL3/4) play an active role in this process. We demonstrate that in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, MLL3/4-dependent deposition of H3K4me1 at enhancers correlates with increased levels of chromatin interactions, whereas loss of this histone modification leads to reduced levels of chromatin interactions and defects in gene activation during differentiation. H3K4me1 facilitates recruitment of the Cohesin complex, a known regulator of chromatin organization, to chromatin in vitro and in vivo, providing a potential mechanism for MLL3/4 to promote chromatin interactions between enhancers and promoters. Taken together, our results support a role for MLL3/4-dependent H3K4me1 in orchestrating long-range chromatin interactions at enhancers in mammalian cells.},

We describe a mammalian silencer blocking assay using insulator elements positioned between retrovirus silencer elements and an LCR{$\beta$}-globin reporter transgene. In transgenic mice, we show that retrovirus silencers are blocked by the cHS4 insulator. Silencer blocking is independent of the CTCF binding site and is most effective when flanking the internal reporter transgene. These data distinguish silencer blocking activity by cHS4 from its enhancer blocking activity. Retrovirus vectors can be created at high titer with one but not two internal dimer cHS4 cores. cHS4 in the LTRs has no effect on expression in transduced F9 cells, suggesting that position effect blocking is not sufficient to escape silencing. The Drosophila insulators gypsy and Scs fail to block silencing in transgenic mice, but gypsy stimulates vector expression 2-fold when located in the LTRs of an infectious retrovirus. The silencer blocking assay complements existing insulator assays in mammalian cells, provides new insight into mechanisms of insulation and is a valuable tool to identify additional silencer blocking insulators that cooperate with cHS4 to improve stem cell retrovirus vector design.},

Cultured tobacco cells collected on filter papers were bombarded with tungsten particles coated with pUC118 or pBI101.3 (negative controls), pBI505 (positive nuclear control) or a chloroplast expression vector (pHD203-GUS), and were assayed for GUS activity. No GUS activity was detected in cells bombarded with pUC118 or pBI101.3. Cells bombarded with pBI505 showed high levels of expression with blue color being distributed evenly throughout the whole cytosol of the transformants. pHD203-GUS was expressed exclusively in chloroplasts. We base this conclusion on: i) the procaryotic nature of the promoter used in the chloroplast expression vector; ii) delayed GUS staining; iii) localization of blue color within subcellular compartments corresponding to plastids in both shape and size; and iv) confirmation of organelle-specific expression of pHD203-GUS using PEG-mediated protoplast transformation. Chloroplast transformation efficiencies increased dramatically (about 200-fold) using an improved helium-driven biolistic device, as compared to the more commonly used gun powder charge-driven device. Using GUS as a reporter gene and the improved biolistic device, optimal bombardment conditions were established, consistently producing several hundred transient chloroplast transformants per Petri plate. Chloroplast transformation efficiency was found to be increased further (20-fold) with supplemental osmoticum (0.55 M sorbitol and 0.55 M mannitol) in the bombardment and incubation medium. This system provides a highly effective mechanism for introducing and expressing plasmid DNA within higher-plant chloroplasts, and the fact that GUS functions as an effective marker gene now makes many genetic studies possible which were not possible before.},

  abstract = {Despite the fact that most cancer cells display high glycolytic activity, cancer cells selectively express the less active M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2). Here we demonstrate that PKM2 expression makes a critical regulatory contribution to the serine synthetic pathway. In the absence of serine, an allosteric activator of PKM2, glycolytic efflux to lactate is significantly reduced in PKM2-expressing cells. This inhibition of PKM2 results in the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates that feed into serine synthesis. As a consequence, PKM2-expressing cells can maintain mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 activity and proliferate in serine-depleted medium, but PKM1-expressing cells cannot. Cellular detection of serine depletion depends on general control nonderepressible 2 kinase-activating transcription factor 4 (GCN2-ATF4) pathway activation and results in increased expression of enzymes required for serine synthesis from the accumulating glycolytic precursors. These findings suggest that tumor cells use serine-dependent regulation of PKM2 and GCN2 to modulate the flux of glycolytic intermediates in support of cell proliferation.},

In a process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), besides changing their adhesive repertoire, cancer cells employ developmental processes to gain migratory and invasive properties that involve a dramatic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the concomitant formation of membrane protrusions required for invasive growth. The molecular processes underlying such cellular changes are still only poorly understood, and the various migratory organelles, including lamellipodia, filopodia, invadopodia and podosomes, still require a better functional and molecular characterization. Notably, direct experimental evidence linking the formation of migratory membrane protrusions and the process of EMT and tumor metastasis is still lacking. In this review, we have summarized recent novel insights into the molecular processes and players underlying EMT on one side and the formation of invasive membrane protrusions on the other side.},

Cancer cells invade normal tissue as epithelial sheets or single cells by inducing expression of programs characteristic of developmental processes.

Recent experimental evidence suggests that metastasis requires changes not only in cancer cells but also in the tumor microenvironment and in the metastatic target site. For example, a premetastatic niche is formed in target organs that attract cancer cells. Understanding the distinct mechanisms used by cancer cells to form metastasis will enable better patient evaluation and the design of innovative therapeutic approaches.},

During exonucleolytic trimming, the sequences between the snoRNAs are~not degraded, leading to the accumulation of lncRNAs flanked by snoRNA sequences but lacking 5{${'}$} caps and 3{${'}$} poly(A) tails. Such RNAs are widely expressed in cells and tissues and can be produced by~either box C/D or box H/ACA snoRNAs. Importantly, the genomic region encoding one abundant class of sno-lncRNAs (15q11-q13) is specifically deleted in Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). The PWS region sno-lncRNAs do not colocalize with nucleoli or Cajal bodies, but rather accumulate near their sites of synthesis. These sno-lncRNAs associate strongly with Fox family splicing regulators and alter patterns of splicing. These results thus implicate a previously unannotated class of lncRNAs in the molecular pathogenesis of PWS.},

To facilitate their application, we conducted a genome-wide insertion site profiling of the piggyBac (PB), Tol2 and Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposons and the murine leukemia virus (MLV) in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). PB and MLV preferred highly expressed genes, whereas Tol2 and SB preferred weakly expressed genes. However, correlations with DNase I hypersensitive sites were different for all vectors, indicating that chromatin accessibility is not the sole determinant. Therefore, we analysed various chromatin states. PB and MLV highly correlated with Cohesin, Mediator and ESC-specific transcription factors. Notably, CTCF sites were correlated with PB but not with MLV, suggesting MLV prefers smaller promoter\textendash enhancer loops, whereas PB insertion encompasses larger chromatin loops termed topologically associating domains. Tol2 also correlated with Cohesin and CTCF. However, correlations with ESC-specific transcription factors were weaker, suggesting that Tol2 prefers transcriptionally weak chromatin loops. Consistently, Tol2 insertions were associated with bivalent histone modifications characteristic of silent and inducible loci. SB showed minimum preference to all chromatin states, suggesting the least adverse effect on adjacent genes. These results will be useful for vector selection for various applications.},

We showed earlier that a 2300 bp upstream sequence suffices to faithfully recreate this pattern of expression when fused to a CAT reporter gene. Here we define the functional organization of this cis-regulatory domain, which includes over thirty high specificity binding sites, serviced by at least thirteen different putative transcription factors, in addition to \&gt;20 sites for a factor commonly found in the regulatory sequences of other sea urchin genes as well (SpGCF1). The Endo16 cis-regulatory domain consists of several different functional elements, or modules, each containing one or two unique DNA-binding factor target sites, plus sites for factors binding in other modules as well. Modular regulatory function was defined in experiments in which regions of the cis-regulatory DNA containing specific clusters of sites were tested in isolation, combined with one another, or by selective deletion, and the effects on expression of the CAT reporter were determined by whole-mount in situ hybridization or CAT enzyme activity measurements. The most proximal module (A) is mainly responsible for early embryonic expression, and module A alone suffices to locate expression in the vegetal plate and archenteron. The adjacent module (B) is responsible for a steep postgastrular rise in expression, when the gene is transcribed only in the midgut and, prior to this module B alone also suffices to promote expression in the vegetal plate and archenteron. The most distal module, G, acts as a booster for either A or B modules. However, no combination of A, B and G modules generates vegetal plate or gut expression exclusively. Ectopic expression of A-, B- and G-CAT fusion constructs occurs in the adjacent (veg1-derived) ectoderm and in skeletogenic mesenchyme cells. For expression to be confined to endoderm requires negative regulatory functions mediated by modules E, F and DC. Modules E and F each repress ectopic expression specifically in veg1 ectoderm. Module DC represses ectopic expression specifically in skeletogenic mesenchyme. Expression of some Endo16 constructs is dramatically increased by treatment with LiCl, which expands the territory in which the endogenous Endo16 gene is expressed at the expense of veg1 ectoderm. The same modules that act to repress ectopic expression in untreated embryos are required for enhanced expression of constructs after LiC1 treatment. Furthermore, both the negative spatial control functions and response to LiC1 require the presence of module A. The total regulatory requirements of the Endo16 gene during embryogenesis can be expressed in terms of the positive and negative functions of the individual modules and the interactions between modules that are identified in this study.},

We previously showed that the absence of Sall4 leads to lethality during peri-implantation and that Sall4-null embryonic stem (ES) cells proliferate poorly with intact pluripotency when cultured on feeder cells. Here, we report that, in the absence of feeder cells, Sall4-null ES cells express the trophectoderm marker Cdx2, but are maintained for a long period in an undifferentiated state with minimally affected Oct3/4 expression. Feeder-free Sall4-null ES cells contribute solely to the inner cell mass and epiblast in vivo, indicating that these cells still retain pluripotency and do not fully commit to the trophectoderm. These phenotypes could arise from derepression of the Cdx2 promoter, which is normally suppressed by Sall4 and the Mi2/NuRD HDAC complex. However, proliferation was impaired and G1 phase prolonged in the absence of Sall4, suggesting another role for Sall4 in cell cycle control. Although Sall1, also a Sall family gene, is known to genetically interact with Sall4 in vivo, Sall1-null ES cells have no apparent defects and no exacerbation is observed in ES cells lacking both Sall1 and Sall4, compared with Sall4-null cells. This suggests a unique role for Sall4 in ES cells. Thus, though Sall4 does not contribute to the central machinery of the pluripotency, it stabilizes ES cells by repressing aberrant trophectoderm gene expression.},

However, some plant species do not require VirF for transformation. Here, we show that Agrobacterium induces expression of a plant F-box protein, which we designated VBF for VIP1-binding F-box protein, that can functionally replace VirF, regulating levels of the VirE2 and VIP1 proteins via a VBF-containing SCF complex. When expressed in Agrobacterium and exported into the plant cell, VBF functionally complements tumor formation by a strain lacking VirF. VBF expression is known to be induced by diverse pathogens, suggesting that Agrobacterium has co-opted a plant defense response and that bacterial VirF and plant VBF both contribute to targeted proteolysis that promotes plant genetic transformation.},

The RNA polymerase II core promoter is the ultimate target of a multitude of transcription factors that control transcription initiation. Core promoters consist of core promoter motifs, e.g. the initiator, TATA box, and the downstream core promoter element (DPE), which confer specific properties to the core promoter. Here, we explored the importance of core promoter functions in the dorsal-ventral developmental gene regulatory network. This network includes multiple genes that are activated by different nuclear concentrations of Dorsal, an NF{$\kappa$}B homolog transcription factor, along the dorsal-ventral axis. We show that over two-thirds of Dorsal target genes contain DPE sequence motifs, which is significantly higher than the proportion of DPE-containing promoters in Drosophila genes. We demonstrate that multiple Dorsal target genes are evolutionarily conserved and functionally dependent on the DPE. Furthermore, we have analyzed the activation of key Dorsal target genes by Dorsal, as well as by another Rel family transcription factor, Relish, and the dependence of their activation on the DPE motif. Using hybrid enhancer-promoter constructs in Drosophila cells and embryo extracts, we have demonstrated that the core promoter composition is an important determinant of transcriptional activity of Dorsal target genes. Taken together, our results provide evidence for the importance of core promoter composition in the regulation of Dorsal target genes.},

  abstract = {Background \&amp; Aims Recent evidence suggests that hepatocellular carcinoma can be classified into certain molecular subtypes with distinct prognoses based on the stem/maturational status of the tumor. We investigated the transcription program deregulated in hepatocellular carcinomas with stem cell features. Methods Gene and protein expression profiles were obtained from 238 (analyzed by microarray), 144 (analyzed by immunohistochemistry), and 61 (analyzed by qRT-PCR) hepatocellular carcinoma cases. Activation/suppression of an identified transcription factor was used to evaluate its role in cell lines. The relationship of the transcription factor and prognosis was statistically examined. Results The transcription factor SALL4, known to regulate stemness in embryonic and hematopoietic stem cells, was found to be activated in a hepatocellular carcinoma subtype with stem cell features. SALL4-positive hepatocellular carcinoma patients were associated with high values of serum alpha fetoprotein, high frequency of hepatitis B virus infection, and poor prognosis after surgery compared with SALL4-negative patients. Activation of SALL4 enhanced spheroid formation and invasion capacities, key characteristics of cancer stem cells, and up-regulated the hepatic stem cell markers KRT19, EPCAM, and CD44 in cell lines. Knockdown of SALL4 resulted in the down-regulation of these stem cell markers, together with attenuation of the invasion capacity. The SALL4 expression status was associated with histone deacetylase activity in cell lines, and the histone deacetylase inhibitor successfully suppressed proliferation of SALL4-positive hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Conclusions SALL4 is a valuable biomarker and therapeutic target for the diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with stem cell features.},

Furthermore, depletion of Malat1 does not affect global gene expression, splicing factor level and phosphorylation status, or alternative pre-mRNA splicing.

In an attempt to create contact domains, we inserted a 2-kb DNA sequence underlying a tissue-invariant domain boundary\textemdash containing a CTCF-binding site (CBS) and a transcription start site (TSS)\textemdash into 16 ectopic loci across 11 chromosomes, and characterized its architectural impact. Depending on local constraints, this fragment variably formed new domains, partitioned existing ones, altered compartmentalization and initiated contacts reflecting chromatin loop extrusion. Deletions of the CBS or the TSS individually or in combination within inserts revealed its distinct contributions to genome folding. Altogether, short DNA insertions can suffice to shape the spatial genome in a manner influenced by chromatin context.},

We have recently shown that exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to hypoxia (1\% O(2)) increases gene expression and bioactivation of TGF-beta2 and induces its downstream effectors, Smad proteins (Smads), to associate with DNA. In the present study, we show that hypoxia-induced TGF-beta2 gene expression is dependent on thrombospondin-1-mediated bioactivation of latent TGF-beta. Blocking TGF-beta2 but not TGF-beta1 in hypoxic endothelial cell cultures inhibited induction of the TGF-beta2 gene, indicating that an autocrine mechanism driven by bioactivation of TGF-beta2 leads to its gene expression in hypoxic HUVECs. Exposure of HUVECs to hypoxia resulted in phosphorylation and nuclear transportation of Smad2 and Smad3 proteins as well as stimulation of transcriptional activities of Smad3 and the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and culminated in up-regulation of TGF-beta2 gene expression. Autocrine regulation of TGF-beta2 production in hypoxia may involve cross-talk between Smad3 and HIF-1alpha signaling pathways, and could be an important mechanism by which endothelial cells respond to hypoxic stress.},

A unique network of transcription factors and signalling molecules are essential for maintaining this capability. Here, we report that a spalt family member, Sall4, is required for the pluripotency of ES cells. Similarly to Oct4, a reduction in Sall4 levels in mouse ES cells results in respecification, under the appropriate culture conditions, of ES cells to the trophoblast lineage. Sall4 regulates transcription of Pou5f1 which encodes Oct4. Sall4 binds to the highly conserved regulatory region of the Pou5f1 distal enhancer and activates Pou5f1 expression in vivo and in vitro. Microinjection of Sall4 small interfering (si) RNA into mouse zygotes resulted in reduction of Sall4 and Oct4 mRNAs in preimplantation embryos and significant expansion of Cdx2 expression into the inner cell mass. These results demonstrate that Sall4 is a transcriptional activator of Pou5f1 and has a critical role in the maintenance of ES cell pluripotency by modulating Oct4 expression. The data also indicates that Sall4 is important for early embryonic cell-fate decisions.},

Enforced expression of SALL4 enhanced the proliferation and migration of human gastric cancer cells, whereas knockdown of SALL4 by siRNA led to the opposite effects. In addition, SALL4 overexpression promoted the growth and metastasis of gastric xenograft tumor in vivo. SALL4 overexpression induced epithelial\textendash mesenchymal transition (EMT) in gastric cancer cells, with increased expression of Twist1, N-cadherin and decreased expression of E-cadherin. Moreover, SALL4 promoted the acquirement of stemness in gastric cancer cells through the induction of Bmi-1 and Lin28B.

In this study, we investigate the role of {$\beta$}-catenin in hypoxia-induced EMT in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Induction of EMT in HCC cell lines by hypoxia was confirmed by altered morphology, expression change of EMT-associated markers and enhanced invasion capacity. We showed that hypoxia-induced EMT could be enhanced by addition of recombinant Wnt3a while it was repressed by {$\beta$}-catenin small interfering RNA. An interaction between {$\beta$}-catenin and hypoxia-induced factor-1{$\alpha$} (hif-1{$\alpha$}) was found, and an underlying competition for {$\beta$}-catenin between hif-1{$\alpha$} and T-cell factor-4 was implied. Notably, increased hif-1{$\alpha$} activity was accompanied with more significant EMT features. We also showed that the pro-EMT effect of {$\beta$}-catenin in hypoxia was deprived in the absence of hif-1{$\alpha$}. Moreover, {$\beta$}-catenin was found to be responsible for the maintenance of viability and proliferation for tumor cells undergoing hypoxia. We further showed a correlation between hif-1{$\alpha$} and {$\beta$}-catenin expression, and corresponding expression of EMT-associated markers in human HCC tissues. Our results suggest that Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signaling enhances hypoxia-induced EMT in HCC by increasing the EMT-associated activity of hif-1{$\alpha$} and preventing tumor cell death.},

However, the molecular mechanism for EGF signaling in promoting PCa metastasis remains elusive. Using experimental models of PCa metastasis, we demonstrated that EGF could induce robust epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increase invasiveness. Interestingly, EGF was found to be capable of promoting protein turnover of epithelial protein lost in neoplasm (EPLIN), a putative suppressor of EMT and tumor metastasis. Mechanistic study revealed that EGF could activate the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of EPLIN through an extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)-dependent signaling cascade. Pharmacological inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway effectively antagonized EGF-induced EPLIN degradation. Two serine residues, i.e. serine 362 and serine 604, were identified as putative ERK1/2 phosphorylation sites in human EPLIN, whose point mutation rendered resistance to EGF-induced protein turnover. This study elucidated a novel molecular mechanism for EGF regulation of EMT and invasiveness in PCa cells, indicating that blockade of EGF signaling could be beneficial in preventing and retarding PCa metastasis at early stages.},

  abstract = {Gene expression variability, differences in the number of mRNA per cell across a population of cells, is ubiquitous across diverse organisms with broad impacts on cellular phenotypes. The role of chromatin in regulating average gene expression has been extensively studied. However, what aspects of the chromatin contribute to gene expression variability is still underexplored. Here we addressed this problem by leveraging chromatin diversity and using a systematic investigation of randomly integrated expression reporters to identify what aspects of chromatin microenvironment contribute to gene expression variability. Using DNA barcoding and split-pool decoding, we created a large library of isogenic reporter clones and identified reporter integration sites in a massive and parallel manner. By mapping our measurements of reporter expression at different genomic loci with multiple epigenetic profiles including the enrichment of transcription factors and the distance to different chromatin states, we identified new factors that impact the regulation of gene expression distributions.},

  abstract = {Chromatin architecture has been implicated in cell type-specific gene regulatory programs, yet how chromatin remodels during development remains to be fully elucidated. Here, by interrogating chromatin reorganization during human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) differentiation, we discover a role for the primate-specific endogenous retrotransposon human endogenous retrovirus subfamily H (HERV-H) in creating topologically associating domains (TADs) in hPSCs. Deleting these HERV-H elements eliminates their corresponding TAD boundaries and reduces the transcription of upstream genes, while de novo insertion of HERV-H elements can introduce new TAD boundaries. The ability of HERV-H to create TAD boundaries depends on high transcription, as transcriptional repression of HERV-H elements prevents the formation of boundaries. This ability is not limited to hPSCs, as these actively transcribed HERV-H elements and their corresponding TAD boundaries also appear in pluripotent stem cells from other hominids but not in more distantly related species lacking HERV-H elements. Overall, our results provide direct evidence for retrotransposons in actively shaping cell type- and species-specific chromatin architecture.},

However, the unknown functional relevance of TCR profiling hinders unbiased interpretation of the biology of T cells. To address this inadequacy, we developed tessa, a tool to integrate TCRs with gene expression of T cells to estimate the effect that TCRs confer on the phenotypes of T cells. Tessa leveraged techniques combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with TCR sequencing. We validated tessa and showed its superiority over existing approaches that investigate only the TCR sequences. With tessa, we demonstrated that TCR similarity constrains the phenotypes of T cells to be similar and dictates a gradient in antigen targeting efficiency of T cell clonotypes with convergent TCRs. We showed this constraint could predict a functional dichotomization of T cells postimmunotherapy treatment and is weakened in tumor contexts.},

We use RNA interference to model heterogeneous tumors, and demonstrate successful validation of computational predictions for how optimized drug combinations can yield superior effects on these tumors both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, we discover here that for many such tumors knowledge of the predominant subpopulation is insufficient for determining the best drug combination. Surprisingly, in some cases the optimal drug combination does not include drugs that would treat any particular subpopulation most effectively, challenging straightforward intuition. We confirm examples of such a case with survival studies in a murine pre-clinical lymphoma model.

  abstract = {Tumors within each cancer patient have been found to be extensively heterogeneous both spatially across distinct regions and temporally in response to treatment. This poses challenges for prognostic/diagnostic biomarker identification and rational design of optimal drug combinations to minimize reoccurrence. Here we present a computational approach incorporating drug efficacy and drug side effects to derive effective drug combinations and study how tumor heterogeneity affects drug selection. We find that considering subpopulations beyond just the predominant subpopulation in a heterogeneous tumor may result in nonintuitive drug combinations. Additional analyses reveal general properties of effective drugs. This study highlights the importance of optimizing drug combinations in the context of intratumor heterogeneity and offers a principled approach toward their rational design., The substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity observed in patient tumors poses considerable challenges for the design of effective drug combinations with predictable outcomes. Currently, the implications of tissue heterogeneity and sampling bias during diagnosis are unclear for selection and subsequent performance of potential combination therapies. Here, we apply a multiobjective computational optimization approach integrated with empirical information on efficacy and toxicity for individual drugs with respect to a spectrum of genetic perturbations, enabling derivation of optimal drug combinations for heterogeneous tumors comprising distributions of subpopulations possessing these perturbations. Analysis across probabilistic samplings from the spectrum of various possible distributions reveals that the most beneficial (considering both efficacy and toxicity) set of drugs changes as the complexity of genetic heterogeneity increases. Importantly, a significant likelihood arises that a drug selected as the most beneficial single agent with respect to the predominant subpopulation in fact does not reside within the most broadly useful drug combinations for heterogeneous tumors. The underlying explanation appears to be that heterogeneity essentially homogenizes the benefit of drug combinations, reducing the special advantage of a particular drug on a specific subpopulation. Thus, this study underscores the importance of considering heterogeneity in choosing drug combinations and offers a principled approach toward designing the most likely beneficial set, even if the subpopulation distribution is not precisely known.},

Nuclear neighborhoods associated with transcriptional repression include the inner nuclear membrane/nuclear lamina and peri-nucleolar chromatin, whereas neighborhoods surrounding the nuclear pore complex, PML nuclear bodies, and nuclear speckles seem to be transcriptionally permissive. While nuclear position appears to play an important role in gene expression, it is likely to be only one piece of a flexible puzzle that incorporates numerous parameters.

We assayed a library of core promoters in a mixture of HEK293 and K562 cells and showed that scMPRA is a reproducible, highly parallel, single-cell reporter gene assay that detects cell-type specific cis-regulatory activity. We then measured a library of promoter variants across multiple cell types in ex vivo mouse retinas and showed that subtle genetic variants can produce cell-type specific effects on cis-regulatory activity.

Here, we exploit position effects on expression as an indicator of chromatin activity and infer the chromatin activity landscape in every lineaged cell during Caenorhabditis elegans early embryogenesis. Systems-level analyses reveal that chromatin activity distinguishes cellular states and correlates with fate patterning in the early embryos. As cell lineage unfolds, chromatin activity diversifies in a lineage-dependent manner, with switch-like changes accompanying anterior?posterior fate asymmetry and characteristic landscapes being established in different cell lineages. Upon tissue differentiation, cellular chromatin from distinct lineages converges according to tissue types but retains stable memories of lineage history, contributing to intra-tissue cell heterogeneity. However, the chromatin landscapes of cells organized in a left?right symmetric pattern are predetermined to be analogous in early progenitors so as to pre-set equivalent states. Finally, genome-wide analysis identifies many regions exhibiting concordant chromatin activity changes that mediate the co-regulation of functionally related genes during differentiation. Collectively, our study reveals the developmental and genomic dynamics of chromatin activity at the single-cell level.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Short tandem repeat (STR) instability is causally linked to pathologic transcriptional silencing in a subset of repeat expansion disorders. In fragile X syndrome (FXS), instability of a single CGG STR tract is thought to repress FMR1 via local DNA methylation. Here, we report the acquisition of more than ten Megabase-sized H3K9me3 domains in FXS, including a 5-8 Megabase block around FMR1. Distal H3K9me3 domains encompass synaptic genes with STR instability, and spatially co-localize in trans concurrently with FMR1 CGG expansion and the dissolution of TADs. CRISPR engineering of mutation-length FMR1 CGG to normal-length preserves heterochromatin, whereas cut-out to pre-mutation-length attenuates a subset of H3K9me3 domains. Overexpression of a pre-mutation-length CGG de-represses both FMR1 and distal heterochromatinized genes, indicating that long-range H3K9me3-mediated silencing is exquisitely sensitive to STR length. Together, our data uncover a genome-wide surveillance mechanism by which STR tracts spatially communicate over vast distances to heterochromatinize the pathologically unstable genome in FXS.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract Mammalian transcription occurs stochastically in short bursts interspersed by silent intervals showing a refractory period. However, the underlying processes and consequences on fluctuations in gene products are poorly understood. Here, we use single allele time-lapse recordings in mouse cells to identify minimal models of promoter cycles, which inform on the number and durations of rate-limiting steps responsible for refractory periods. The structure of promoter cycles is gene specific and independent of genomic location. Typically, five rate-limiting steps underlie the silent periods of endogenous promoters, while minimal synthetic promoters exhibit only one. Strikingly, endogenous or synthetic promoters with TATA boxes show simplified two-state promoter cycles. Since transcriptional bursting constrains intrinsic noise depending on the number of promoter steps, this explains why TATA box genes display increased intrinsic noise genome-wide in mammals, as revealed by single-cell RNA-seq. These findings have implications for basic transcription biology and shed light on interpreting single-cell RNA-counting experiments.},

  abstract = {The large variability in mRNA and protein levels found from both static and dynamic measurements in single cells has been largely attributed to random periods of transcription, often occurring in bursts. The cell cycle has a pronounced global role in affecting transcriptional and translational output, but how this influences transcriptional statistics from noisy promoters is unknown and generally ignored by current stochastic models. Here we show that variable transcription from the synthetic tetO promoter in S. cerevisiae is dominated by its dependence on the cell cycle. Real-time measurements of fluorescent protein at high expression levels indicate tetO promoters increase transcription rate {$\sim$}2-fold in S/G2/M similar to constitutive genes. At low expression levels, where tetO promoters are thought to generate infrequent bursts of transcription, we observe random pulses of expression restricted to S/G2/M, which are correlated between homologous promoters present in the same cell. The analysis of static, single-cell mRNA measurements at different points along the cell cycle corroborates these findings. Our results demonstrate that highly variable mRNA distributions in yeast are not solely the result of randomly switching between periods of active and inactive gene expression, but instead largely driven by differences in transcriptional activity between G1 and S/G2/M.},

We found that the number of clusters was positively correlated only with maternal age and that maternal clusters consist of more individual mutations with larger intra-mutational distances compared to paternal clusters. Maternal clusters were enriched at specific loci on chromosomes 8, 9 and 16 in regions with increased maternal mutation rate. Moreover, maternal clusters in these regions showed a distinct mutation signature characterized by C{\textgreater}G mutations. Finally, we found that maternal clusters associate with processes involving double-stranded-breaks (DSBs) such as meiotic gene conversions, de novo deletions events and recombination. These findings suggest accumulation of DSB-induced mutations throughout oocyte aging as an underlying mechanism leading to maternal mutation clusters.},

Given this disparity in numbers, it might be expected that the more precious commodity—eggs—would be subject to more stringent quality-control mechanisms. However, information from engineered mutations of meiotic genes suggests just the opposite. Specifically, the available mutants demonstrate striking sexual dimorphism in response to meiotic disruption; for example, faced with adversity, male meiosis grinds to a halt, whereas female meiosis soldiers on. This female “robustness” comes with a cost, however, because aneuploidy appears to be increased in the resultant oocytes.},

	abstract = {To fully understand human genetic variation, one must assess the specific distribution of variants between the two chromosomal homologues of genes, and any functional units of interest, as the phase of variants can significantly impact gene function and phenotype. To this end, we have systematically analyzed 18,121 autosomal protein-coding genes in 1,092 statistically phased genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project, and an unprecedented number of 184 experimentally phased genomes from the Personal Genome Project. Here we show that mutations predicted to functionally alter the protein, and coding variants as a whole, are not randomly distributed between the two homologues of a gene, but do occur significantly more frequently in cis- than trans-configurations, with cis/trans ratios of {\textasciitilde}60:40. Significant cis-abundance was observed in virtually all individual genomes in all populations. Nearly all variable genes exhibited either cis, or trans configurations of protein-altering mutations in significant excess, allowing distinction of cis- and trans-abundant genes. These common patterns of phase were largely constituted by a shared, global set of phase-sensitive genes. We show significant enrichment of this global set with gene sets indicating its involvement in adaptation and evolution. Moreover, cis- and trans-abundant genes were found functionally distinguishable, and exhibited strikingly different distributional patterns of protein-altering mutations. This work establishes common patterns of phase as key characteristics of diploid human exomes and provides evidence for their potential functional significance. Thus, it highlights the importance of phase for the interpretation of protein-coding genetic variation, challenging the current conceptual and functional interpretation of autosomal genes.},

Examples include the common mutations at one or a few sites in the genes that cause achondroplasia, Apert syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B, and Noonan syndrome. These mutations are recurrent, provide a gain of function, are paternally derived, and are more likely to be transmitted as the father ages. Recent experiments have tested whether the high mutation frequencies are due to an elevated mutation rate per cell division, as expected, or to an advantage of the mutant spermatogonial stem cells over wild-type stem cells. The evidence, which includes the surprising discovery of testis mutation clusters, rules out the former model but not the latter. We propose how the mutations might alter spermatogonial stem cell function and discuss how germline selection contributes to the paternal age effect, the human mutational load, and adaptive evolution.},

	abstract = {The human haptoglobin (HP) HP*2 allele contains a 1.7-kilobase (kb) intragenic duplication that arose after a unique nonhomologous recombination between the prototype HP*1 alleles. During a genetic screening of 13,000 children of survivors exposed to atomic-bomb radiation and 10,000 children of unexposed persons, two children suspected of carrying de novo mutations at the haptoglobin locus were identified (one in each group). DNA analyses of single-cell-derived colonies of Epstein–Barr virus-transformed B cells revealed that the two children were mosaics comprising HP*2/HP*2 and HP*2/HP*1 cells at a ratio of ≈3:1. We infer that the latter cells are caused by reversion of one HP*2 allele to HP*1 through an intramolecular homologous recombination between the duplicated segments of the Hp*2 allele that excised one of the segments. Because the mosaicism is substantial (≈25\%), this recombination must have occurred in early embryogenesis. The frequency of finding these children and the extent of their mosaicisms corresponds to an HP*2 to HP*1 reversion rate of 8 × 10−6 per cell during development. This leads to the prediction that the HP*1 allele also will be represented, although usually at a very low frequency, in any HP2-2 person. We tested this prediction by using PCR for a single individual and found the HP*1 allele at frequencies of 4 × 10−6 and 3 × 10−6 in somatic and sperm cells. The HP*1 allele was detected by PCR in all four other HP2–2 individuals, which supports the regular but rare occurrence somatically of homologous recombination within duplicated regions in humans, in agreement with previous observations in mouse and Drosophila.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Both copies of a gene have normally an equal chance of being inherited; however, some genes can act “selfishly” to be transmitted to {\textgreater}50\% of offspring: a phenomenon known as transmission distortion. Distorting genes on the X or Y chromosome leads to an excess of female/male offspring respectively. This then sets up a “genomic conflict” (arms race) between the sex chromosomes that can radically affect their gene content. Male mice that have lost part of their Y produce {\textgreater}50\% female offspring and show over-activation of multiple genes on the X, providing strong circumstantial evidence for distortion. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a genomic conflict regulated by the genes Slx/Slxl1 and Sly, present in ∼50 to 100 copies on the X and Y chromosomes respectively. SLX/SLXL1 and SLY proteins have antagonistic effects on sex chromosome expression in developing sperm and skew the offspring sex-ratio in favor of females/males. Interestingly, while deficiency of either gene alone leads to severe fertility problems, fertility is improved when both genes are deficient. We believe that the conflict in which Slx/Slxl1 and Sly are involved led to the amplification of X and Y genes and may have played an important role in mouse speciation.},

	abstract = {The human genome contains numerous blocks of highly homologous duplicated sequence. This higher-order architecture provides a substrate for recombination and recurrent chromosomal rearrangement associated with genomic disease. However, an assessment of the role of segmental duplications in normal variation has not yet been made. On the basis of the duplication architecture of the human genome, we defined a set of 130 potential rearrangement hotspots and constructed a targeted bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) microarray (with 2,194 BACs) to assess copy-number variation in these regions by array comparative genomic hybridization. Using our segmental duplication BAC microarray, we screened a panel of 47 normal individuals, who represented populations from four continents, and we identified 119 regions of copy-number polymorphism (CNP), 73 of which were previously unreported. We observed an equal frequency of duplications and deletions, as well as a 4-fold enrichment of CNPs within hotspot regions, compared with control BACs (P {\textless} .000001), which suggests that segmental duplications are a major catalyst of large-scale variation in the human genome. Importantly, segmental duplications themselves were also significantly enriched {\textgreater}4-fold within regions of CNP. Almost without exception, CNPs were not confined to a single population, suggesting that these either are recurrent events, having occurred independently in multiple founders, or were present in early human populations. Our study demonstrates that segmental duplications define hotspots of chromosomal rearrangement, likely acting as mediators of normal variation as well as genomic disease, and it suggests that the consideration of genomic architecture can significantly improve the ascertainment of large-scale rearrangements. Our specialized segmental duplication BAC microarray and associated database of structural polymorphisms will provide an important resource for the future characterization of human genomic disorders.},

	abstract = {Genetic interactions drive selection
Most individuals carry at least some potentially deleterious variants in their genome. But the effects of these mutations on individuals are not well understood. Sohail et al. examined loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the genomes of humans and flies. They found that deleterious LOF mutations are further away from each other in the genome than expected by chance, which suggests that genetic interactions are driving selection. Thus, additional mutations do not exhibit an additive effect, and the overall selective parameter is not driven solely by the total number of mutations within the genome. This explains why high levels of variation can be maintained and why sex and recombination are advantageous.
Science, this issue p. 539
Negative selection against deleterious alleles produced by mutation influences within-population variation as the most pervasive form of natural selection. However, it is not known whether deleterious alleles affect fitness independently, so that cumulative fitness loss depends exponentially on the number of deleterious alleles, or synergistically, so that each additional deleterious allele results in a larger decrease in relative fitness. Negative selection with synergistic epistasis should produce negative linkage disequilibrium between deleterious alleles and, therefore, an underdispersed distribution of the number of deleterious alleles in the genome. Indeed, we detected underdispersion of the number of rare loss-of-function alleles in eight independent data sets from human and fly populations. Thus, selection against rare protein-disrupting alleles is characterized by synergistic epistasis, which may explain how human and fly populations persist despite high genomic mutation rates.
Ongoing selection against rare protein-disrupting mutations depends on an individual’s relative decline in fitness with each additional mutation.

However, how these genes evolved and to what extent they diverged in humans remain to be investigated specifically. Based on syntenic mapping of chordate genomes, we reveal that diverging homologs with a prototypic CEACAM architecture–including an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin variable and constant domain-like regions, and an intracellular domain containing ITAM motif–are present from cartilaginous fish to humans, but are absent in sea lamprey, cephalochordate or urochordate. Interestingly, the CEACAM/PSG gene inventory underwent radical divergence in various vertebrate lineages: from zero in avian species to dozens in therian mammals. In addition, analyses of genetic variations in human populations showed the presence of various types of copy number variations (CNVs) at the CEACAM/PSG locus. These copy number polymorphisms have 3–80\% frequency in select populations, and encompass single to more than six PSG genes. Furthermore, we found that CEACAM/PSG genes contain a significantly higher density of nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) compared to the chromosome average, and many CEACAM/PSG SNPs exhibit high population differentiation. Taken together, our study suggested that CEACAM/PSG genes have had a more dynamic evolutionary history in vertebrates than previously thought. Given that CEACAM/PSGs play important roles in maternal–fetal interaction and pathogen recognition, these data have laid the groundwork for future analysis of adaptive CEACAM/PSG genotype-phenotypic relationships in normal and complicated pregnancies as well as other etiologies.},

	abstract = {BackgroundAlthough the impact of pathogens on the evolution of the mammalian immune system is still under debate, proteins, which both regulate immune responses and serve as cellular receptors for pathogens should be at the forefront of pathogen-driven host evolution. The CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) gene family codes for such proteins and indeed shows tremendous species-specific variation between human and rodents. Since little is known about the CEA gene family in other lineages of placental mammals, we expected to gain new insights into the evolution of the rapidly diverging CEA family by analyzing the CEA family of the dog.ResultsHere we describe the complete CEA gene family in the dog. We found that the gene coding for the ITIM-bearing immunoregulatory molecule CEACAM1 gave rise to a recent expansion of the canine CEA gene family by gene duplication, similar to that previously found in humans and mice. However, while the murine and human CEACAMs (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules) are predominantly secreted and GPI-anchored, respectively, in the dog, most of the CEACAMs represent ITAM-bearing transmembrane proteins. One of these proteins, CEACAM28, exhibits nearly complete sequence identity with the ligand-binding N domain of CEACAM1, but antagonizing signaling motifs in the cytoplasmic tail. Comparison of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions indicates that the CEACAM28 N domain is under the strongest purifying selection of all canine CEACAM1-related CEACAMs. In addition, CEACAM28 shows a similar expression pattern in resting immune cells and tissues as CEACAM1. However, upon activation CEACAM28 mRNA and CEACAM1 mRNA are differentially regulated.ConclusionThus, CEACAM1 and CEACAM28 are the first paired immune receptors identified within the CEA gene family, which are expressed on T cells and are most likely involved in the fine-tuning of T cell responses. The direction of gene conversion accompanied by purifying selection and expression in immune cells suggests the possibility that CEACAM28 evolved in response to selective pressure imposed by species-specific pathogens.},

	abstract = {Background
The pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (Psg) genes encode proteins of unknown function, and are members of the carcinoembryonic antigen (Cea) gene family, which is a member of the immunoglobulin gene (Ig) superfamily. In rodents and primates, but not in artiodactyls (even-toed ungulates / hoofed mammals), there have been independent expansions of the Psg gene family, with all members expressed exclusively in placental trophoblast cells. For the mouse Psg genes, we sought to determine the genomic organisation of the locus, the expression profiles of the various family members, and the evolution of exon structure, to attempt to reconstruct the evolutionary history of this locus, and to determine whether expansion of the gene family has been driven by selection for increased gene dosage, or diversification of function.

Results
We collated the mouse Psg gene sequences currently in the public genome and expressed-sequence tag (EST) databases and used systematic BLAST searches to generate complete sequences for all known mouse Psg genes. We identified a novel family member, Psg31, which is similar to Psg30 but, uniquely amongst mouse Psg genes, has a duplicated N1 domain. We also identified a novel splice variant of Psg16 (bCEA). We show that Psg24 and Psg30 / Psg31 have independently undergone expansion of N-domain number. By mapping BAC, YAC and cosmid clones we described two clusters of Psg genes, which we linked and oriented using fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH). Comparison of our Psg locus map with the public mouse genome database indicates good agreement in overall structure and further elucidates gene order. Expression levels of Psg genes in placentas of different developmental stages revealed dramatic differences in the developmental expression profile of individual family members.

Conclusion
We have combined existing information, and provide new information concerning the evolution of mouse Psg exon organization, the mouse Psg genomic locus structure, and the expression patterns of individual Psg genes. This information will facilitate functional studies of this complex gene family.},

Copy number of AMY1 is reported to be the largest genomic influence on obesity, although genome-wide association studies for obesity have found this locus unremarkable. Using whole-genome sequence analysis, droplet digital PCR and genome mapping, we identified eight common structural haplotypes of the amylase locus that suggest its mutational history. We found that the AMY1 copy number in an individual's genome is generally even (rather than odd) and partially correlates with nearby SNPs, which do not associate with body mass index (BMI). We measured amylase gene copy number in 1,000 obese or lean Estonians and in 2 other cohorts totaling ∼3,500 individuals. We had 99\% power to detect the lower bound of the reported effects on BMI, yet found no association.},

There are ten protein-coding human PSG genes (PSG1 - PSG9, PSG11) and also multiple PSG genes in non-human primates, rodents and bats. Several studies indicate that PSGs have immunoregulatory, pro-angiogenic, and anti-platelet functions. Some PSGs have been shown to bind different moieties on the surface of cells, including the tetraspanin CD9, heparan sulphate, and specific integrins. Recently, PSG1 was shown to associate with and activate the anti-inflammatory cytokines transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and TGF- β2 making PSG1 one of the few known biological activators of these important cytokines. TGF-βs regulate many biological processes essential for pregnancy success including trophoblast invasion and proliferation, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix formation and tolerance to the fetal semi-allograft. As summarized in this review, progress has been made in recent years towards a better understanding of the functions of these proteins which were originally described in the early 1970s, but more research will likely contribute to demonstrate their importance for a successful pregnancy.},

	volume = {4},
	issn = {1568-010X},
	abstract = {The capacity of the pregnancy state to regulate T-cell function is well documented. A consequence of this regulation is that many T-cell mediated autoimmune disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS) are suppressed during pregnancy. The suppression of MS during pregnancy is more potent than the currently available treatments for this disease. Thus, the study of immunoregulatory factors of pregnancy could potentially result in the discovery of novel MS treatments. The regulation of T-cell function during pregnancy is likely the result of significant hormonal changes and may well involve immunoregulatory proteins derived from the placenta. Pregnancy specific glycoproteins (PSGs) are the most abundant placentally derived glycoproteins in the maternal serum. The levels of PSGs are highest during the third trimester of pregnancy, a time marked by the most profound suppression of MS disease attacks. Recent studies by our laboratories, and others, suggest that PSGs regulate T-cell function. We propose this regulation occurs by two distinct, but complementary mechanisms. PSGs may regulate T-cell function by (1) directly signaling tetraspanins present on the cell surface and by (2) regulating T-cell function indirectly through signaling of tetraspanins expressed by macrophages and dendritic cells. In this report, we will review evidence implicating PSGs as important immunoregulatory proteins and discuss our recent findings regarding the mechanisms by which PSGs regulate T-cell function.},

The best approach to prevent pre-eclampsia-associated adverse outcomes is to be able to prevent pre-eclampsia as early as possible. Unfortunately, current diagnostic methods are ineffective at predicting the risk of pre-eclampsia during early pregnancy. In humans, low levels of a group of placenta-derived Pregnancy Specific Glycoproteins (PSGs) have been associated with intrauterine growth retardation and pre-eclampsia and there is a significant enrichment of cases with deletions in the PSG gene locus in pre-eclampsia patients. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that genomic variations at human PSG locus of maternal and/or fetal genomes may confer increased risks of pre-eclampsia. To test this hypothesis, we have recruited 90 normal control and 30 pre-eclamptic women for the analysis of fetal PSG copy number variations (CNVs).The identification of novel PSG CNV-disease relationships will provide not only a better understanding of the pathology of pre-eclampsia but also a novel opportunity to identify patients with a high risk of developing early-onset pre-eclampsia, which has a five- to tenfold higher risk of life-threatening maternal complications and fetal demise as compared to late-onset pre-eclampsia patients.},

	issn = {1932-6203},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0055992},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lysine acetylation is an important post-translational modification that plays a central role in eukaryotic transcriptional activation by modifying chromatin and transcription-related factors. Human pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSG) are the major secreted placental proteins expressed by the syncytiotrophoblast at the end of pregnancy and represent early markers of cytotrophoblast differentiation. Low PSG levels are associated with complicated pregnancies, thus highlighting the importance of studying the mechanisms that control their expression. Despite several transcription factors having been implicated as key regulators of PSG gene family expression; the role of protein acetylation has not been explored.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we explored the role of acetylation on PSG gene expression in the human placental-derived JEG-3 cell line. Pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) up-regulated PSG protein and mRNA expression levels, and augmented the amount of acetylated histone H3 associated with PSG 5'regulatory regions. Moreover, PSG5 promoter activation mediated by Sp1 and KLF6, via the core promoter element motif (CPE, -147/-140), was markedly enhanced in the presence of the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). This effect correlated with an increase in Sp1 acetylation and KLF6 nuclear localization as revealed by immunoprecipitation and subcellular fractionation assays. The co-activators PCAF, p300, and CBP enhanced Sp1-dependent PSG5 promoter activation through their histone acetylase (HAT) function. Instead, p300 and CBP acetyltransferase domain was dispensable for sustaining co-activation of PSG5 promoter by KLF6.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Results are consistent with a regulatory role of lysine acetylation on PSG expression through a relaxed chromatin state and an increase in the transcriptional activity of Sp1 and KLF6 following an augmented Sp1 acetylation and KLF6 nuclear localization.},

Parent-offspring conflict theory suggests that such hypertensive disorders of pregnancy may have evolved through the ability of fetal genes to increase maternal blood pressure as this enhances general nutrient supply. However, such mechanisms for inducing hypertension in pregnancy would need to incur sufficient offspring health benefits to compensate for the obvious risks for maternal and fetal health towards the end of pregnancy in order to explain why these disorders have not been removed by natural selection in our hunter-gatherer ancestors. We analyzed {\textgreater}750,000 live births in the Danish National Patient Registry and all registered medical diagnoses for up to 30 years after birth. We show that offspring exposed to pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) in trimester 1 had significantly reduced overall later-life disease risks, but increased risks when PIH exposure started or developed as preeclampsia in later trimesters. Similar patterns were found for first-year mortality. These results suggest that early PIH leading to improved postpartum survival and health represents a balanced compromise between the reproductive interests of parents and offspring, whereas later onset of PIH may reflect an unbalanced parent-offspring conflict at the detriment of maternal and offspring health.},

Genetic evidence indicates that the light pigmentation variant at SLC24A5 was introduced into East Africa by gene flow from non-Africans. At all other loci, variants associated with dark pigmentation in Africans are identical by descent in southern Asian and Australo-Melanesian populations.

	abstract = {Background
Specific genetic contributions for preeclampsia (PE) are currently unknown. This genome-wide association study (GWAS) aims to identify maternal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy-number variants (CNVs) involved in the etiology of PE.

Methods
A genome-wide scan was performed on 177 PE cases (diagnosed according to National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute guidelines) and 116 normotensive controls. White female study subjects from Iowa were genotyped on Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarrays. CNV calls made using a combination of four detection algorithms (Birdseye, Canary, PennCNV, and QuantiSNP) were merged using CNVision and screened with stringent prioritization criteria. Due to limited DNA quantities and the deleterious nature of copy-number deletions, it was decided a priori that only deletions would be selected for assay on the entire case-control dataset using quantitative real-time PCR.

Results
The top four SNP candidates had an allelic or genotypic p-value between 10-5 and 10-6, however, none surpassed the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold. Three recurrent rare deletions meeting prioritization criteria detected in multiple cases were selected for targeted genotyping. A locus of particular interest was found showing an enrichment of case deletions in 19q13.31 (5/169 cases and 1/114 controls), which encompasses the PSG11 gene contiguous to a highly plastic genomic region. All algorithm calls for these regions were assay confirmed.

Conclusions
CNVs may confer risk for PE and represent interesting regions that warrant further investigation. Top SNP candidates identified from the GWAS, although not genome-wide significant, may be useful to inform future studies in PE genetics.},

	doi = {10.1101/192344},
	abstract = {K562 is one of the most widely used human cell lines in biomedical research. It is one of three tier-one cell lines of ENCODE, and one of the cell lines most commonly used for large-scale CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing screens. Although the functional genomic and epigenomic characteristics of K562 are extensively studied, its genome sequence has never been comprehensively analyzed and higher-order structural features of its genome beyond its karyotype were only cursorily known. The high degree of aneuploidy in K562 renders traditional genome variant analysis methods challenging and partially ineffective. Correct and complete interpretation of the extensive functional genomics data from K562 requires an understanding of the cell line’s genome sequence and genome structure. We performed very-deep short-insert whole-genome sequencing, mate-pair sequencing, linked-read sequencing, karyotyping and array CGH, and used a combination of novel and established computational methods to identify and catalog a wide spectrum of genome sequence variants and genome structural features in K562: copy numbers (CN) of chromosome segments, SNVs and Indels (allele frequency-corrected based on copy-number), phased haplotype blocks (N50 = 2.72 Mb), structural variants (SVs) including complex genomic rearrangements, and novel mobile element insertions. A large fraction of SVs were phased, sequence assembled, and experimentally validated. Many chromosomes show striking loss of heterozygosity. To demonstrate the utility of this knowledge, we re-analyzed K562 RNA-Seq and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data to detect and phase allele-specific expression and DNA methylation patterns, respectively. We show examples where deeper insights into genomic regulatory complexity could be gained by taking knowledge of genomic structural contexts into account. Furthermore, we used the haplotype information to produce a phased CRISPR targeting map, i.e. a catalog of loci where CRISPR guide RNAs will bind in an allele-specific manner. This comprehensive whole-genome analysis serves as a resource for future studies that utilize K562 and as the basis of advanced analyses of the rich amounts of the functional genomics data produced by ENCODE for K562. It is also an example for advanced, integrated whole-genome sequence and structure analysis, beyond standard short-read/short-insert whole-genome sequencing, of human genomes in general and in particular of cancer genomes with large numbers of complex sequence alterations.},

Here we use whole-genome sequences and genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing data to demonstrate that natural selection has profoundly influenced human transcription factor binding sites since the divergence of humans from chimpanzees 4–6 million years ago. Our analysis uses a new probabilistic method, called INSIGHT, for measuring the influence of selection on collections of short, interspersed noncoding elements. We find that, on average, transcription factor binding sites have experienced somewhat weaker selection than protein-coding genes. However, the binding sites of several transcription factors show clear evidence of adaptation. Several measures of selection are strongly correlated with predicted binding affinity. Overall, regulatory elements seem to contribute substantially to both adaptive substitutions and deleterious polymorphisms with key implications for human evolution and disease.},

	abstract = {The relationship between genotype mutations and phenotype variations determines health in the short term and evolution over the long term, and it hinges on the action of mutations on fitness. A fundamental difficulty in determining this action, however, is that it depends on the unique context of each mutation, which is complex and often cryptic. As a result, the effect of most genome variations on molecular function and overall fitness remains unknown and stands apart from population genetics theories linking fitness effect to polymorphism frequency. Here, we hypothesize that evolution is a continuous and differentiable physical process coupling genotype to phenotype. This leads to a formal equation for the action of coding mutations on fitness that can be interpreted as a product of the evolutionary importance of the mutated site with the difference in amino acid similarity. Approximations for these terms are readily computable from phylogenetic sequence analysis, and we show mutational, clinical, and population genetic evidence that this action equation predicts the effect of point mutations in vivo and in vitro in diverse proteins, correlates disease-causing gene mutations with morbidity, and determines the frequency of human coding polymorphisms, respectively. Thus, elementary calculus and phylogenetics can be integrated into a perturbation analysis of the evolutionary relationship between genotype and phenotype that quantitatively links point mutations to function and fitness and that opens a new analytic framework for equations of biology. In practice, this work explicitly bridges molecular evolution with population genetics with applications from protein redesign to the clinical assessment of human genetic variations.},

Thus, we analyzed 34,373 mutations in 14 proteins whose effects were measured using large-scale mutagenesis approaches. Methionine was the most tolerated substitution, while proline was the least tolerated. We found that several substitutions, including histidine and asparagine, best recapitulated the effects of other substitutions, even when the identity of the wild-type amino acid was considered. The effects of histidine and asparagine substitutions also correlated best with the effects of other substitutions in different structural contexts. Furthermore, highly disruptive substitutions like aspartic and glutamic acid had the most discriminatory power for detecting ligand interface positions. Our work highlights the utility of large-scale mutagenesis data, and our conclusions can help guide future single substitution mutational scans.},

	abstract = {Many high-throughput experimental technologies have been developed to assess the effects of large numbers of mutations (variation) on phenotypes. However, designing functional assays for these methods is challenging, and systematic testing of all combinations is impossible, so robust methods to predict the effects of genetic variation are needed. Most prediction methods exploit evolutionary sequence conservation but do not consider the interdependencies of residues or bases. We present EVmutation, an unsupervised statistical method for predicting the effects of mutations that explicitly captures residue dependencies between positions. We validate EVmutation by comparing its predictions with outcomes of high-throughput mutagenesis experiments and measurements of human disease mutations and show that it outperforms methods that do not account for epistasis. EVmutation can be used to assess the quantitative effects of mutations in genes of any organism. We provide pre-computed predictions for ∼7,000 human proteins at http://evmutation.org/.},

Here we use massively parallel assays to measure the effects of nearly 2000 missense substitutions in the RING domain of BRCA1 on its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and its binding to the BARD1 RING domain. From the resulting scores, we generate a model to predict the capacities of full-length BRCA1 variants to support homology-directed DNA repair, the essential role of BRCA1 in tumor suppression, and show that it outperforms widely used biological-effect prediction algorithms.

This discrepancy has engendered concerns about large evolutionary shifts in mutational effects that might confound phylogenetic approaches. Here we experimentally investigate this issue by introducing the same mutations into a set of diverged homologs of the influenza nucleoprotein and measuring the effects on stability. We find that mutational effects on stability are largely conserved across the homologs. We reach qualitatively similar conclusions when we simulate protein evolution with molecular-mechanics force fields. Our results do not mean that proteins evolve without epistasis, which can still arise even when mutational stability effects are conserved. However, our findings indicate that large evolutionary shifts in mutational effects on stability are rare, at least among homologs with similar structures and functions. We suggest that properly describing the clearly observable and highly conserved amino acid preferences at individual sites is likely to be far more important for phylogenetic analyses than accounting for rare shifts in amino acid propensities due to site covariation.},

	abstract = {Genomic sequence interpretation can miss clinically relevant missense variants for several reasons. Rare missense variants are numerous in the exome and difficult to prioritise. Affected genes may also not have existing disease association. To improve variant prioritisation, we leverage population exome data to identify intragenic missense-depleted regions (MDRs) genome-wide that may be important in disease. We then use missense depletion analyses to help prioritise undiagnosed disease exome variants. We demonstrate application of this strategy to identify a novel gene association for human brain malformation. We identified de novo missense variants that affect the GDP/GTP-binding site of ARF1 in three unrelated patients. Corresponding functional analysis suggests ARF1 GDP/GTP-activation is affected by the specific missense mutations associated with heterotopia. These findings expand the genetic pathway underpinning neurologic disease that classically includes FLNA. ARF1 along with ARFGEF2 add further evidence implicating ARF/GEFs in the brain. Using functional ontology, top MDR-containing genes were highly enriched for nucleotide-binding function, suggesting these may be candidates for human disease. Routine consideration of MDR in the interpretation of exome data for rare diseases may help identify strong genetic factors for many severe conditions, infertility/reduction in reproductive capability, and embryonic conditions contributing to preterm loss.},

Recently developed deep-sequencing approaches allow for accurate and simultaneous estimation of the fitness effects of hundreds of engineered mutations by monitoring their relative abundance across time points in a single bulk competition. Naturally, the achievable resolution of the estimated fitness effects depends on the specific experimental setup, the organism and type of mutations studied, and the sequencing technology utilized, among other factors. By means of analytical approximations and simulations, we provide guidelines for optimizing time-sampled deep-sequencing bulk competition experiments, focusing on the number of mutants, the sequencing depth, and the number of sampled time points. Our analytical results show that sampling more time points together with extending the duration of the experiment improves the achievable precision disproportionately compared with increasing the sequencing depth or reducing the number of competing mutants. Even if the duration of the experiment is fixed, sampling more time points and clustering these at the beginning and the end of the experiment increase experimental power and allow for efficient and precise assessment of the entire range of selection coefficients. Finally, we provide a formula for calculating the 95\%-confidence interval for the measurement error estimate, which we implement as an interactive web tool. This allows for quantification of the maximum expected a priori precision of the experimental setup, as well as for a statistical threshold for determining deviations from neutrality for specific selection coefficient estimates.},

Little is currently known, however, about the degree to which such fitness landscapes are dependent on the specific assay conditions from which they are inferred. To explore this issue, we performed comprehensive single-substitution mutational scanning of APH(3')II, a Tn5 transposon-derived kinase that confers resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics, in Escherichia coli under selection with each of six structurally diverse antibiotics at a range of inhibitory concentrations. We found that the resulting local fitness landscapes showed significant dependence on both antibiotic structure and concentration, and that this dependence can be exploited to guide protein engineering. Specifically, we found that differential analysis of fitness landscapes allowed us to generate synthetic APH(3')II variants with orthogonal substrate specificities.},

Traditional approaches to study these properties have typically required the direct measurement of the property of interest, oftentimes a laborious undertaking. Although protein properties can be probed by mutagenesis, this approach has been limited by its low throughput. Recent technological developments have enabled the rapid quantification of a protein’s function, such as binding to a ligand, for numerous variants of that protein. Here, we measure the ability of 47,000 variants of a WW domain to bind to a peptide ligand and use these functional measurements to identify stabilizing mutations without directly assaying stability. Our approach is rooted in the well-established concept that protein function is closely related to stability. Protein function is generally reduced by destabilizing mutations, but this decrease can be rescued by stabilizing mutations. Based on this observation, we introduce partner potentiation, a metric that uses this rescue ability to identify stabilizing mutations, and identify 15 candidate stabilizing mutations in the WW domain. We tested six candidates by thermal denaturation and found two highly stabilizing mutations, one more stabilizing than any previously known mutation. Thus, physicochemical properties such as stability are latent within these large-scale protein functional data and can be revealed by systematic analysis. This approach should allow other protein properties to be discovered.},

A large-scale comparison of real and possible histories would establish whether the outcome of evolution represents an optimal state driven by natural selection or the contingent product of historical chance events1; it would also reveal how the underlying distribution of functions across sequence space shaped historical evolution2,3. Here we combine ancestral protein reconstruction4 with deep mutational scanning5,6,7,8,9,10 to characterize alternative histories in the sequence space around an ancient transcription factor, which evolved a novel biological function through well-characterized mechanisms11,12. We find hundreds of alternative protein sequences that use diverse biochemical mechanisms to perform the derived function at least as well as the historical outcome. These alternatives all require prior permissive substitutions that do not enhance the derived function, but not all require the same permissive changes that occurred during history. We find that if evolution had begun from a different starting point within the network of sequences encoding the ancestral function, outcomes with different genetic and biochemical forms would probably have resulted; this contingency arises from the distribution of functional variants in sequence space and epistasis between residues. Our results illuminate the topology of the vast space of possibilities from which history sampled one path, highlighting how the outcome of evolution depends on a serial chain of compounding chance events.},

	abstract = {Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) fundamentally limit the utility of genetic information in a clinical setting. The challenge of VUS is epitomized by BRCA1, a tumor suppressor gene integral to DNA repair and genomic stability. Germline BRCA1 loss-of-function (LOF) variants predispose women to early-onset breast and ovarian cancers. Although BRCA1 has been sequenced in millions of women, the risk associated with most newly observed variants cannot be definitively assigned. Data sharing attenuates this problem but it is unlikely to solve it, as most newly observed variants are exceedingly rare. In lieu of genetic evidence, experimental approaches can be used to functionally characterize VUS. However, to date, functional studies of BRCA1 VUS have been conducted in a post hoc, piecemeal fashion. Here we employ saturation genome editing to assay 96.5\% of all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 13 exons that encode functionally critical domains of BRCA1. Our assay measures cellular fitness in a haploid human cell line whose survival is dependent on intact BRCA1 function. The resulting function scores for nearly 4,000 SNVs are bimodally distributed and almost perfectly concordant with established assessments of pathogenicity. Sequence-function maps enhanced by parallel measurements of variant effects on mRNA levels reveal mechanisms by which loss-of-function SNVs arise. Hundreds of missense SNVs critical for protein function are identified, as well as dozens of exonic and intronic SNVs that compromise BRCA1 function by disrupting splicing or transcript stability. We predict that these function scores will be directly useful for the clinical interpretation of cancer risk based on BRCA1 sequencing. Furthermore, we propose that this paradigm can be extended to overcome the challenge of VUS in other genes in which genetic variation is clinically actionable.},

Genetic testing for mutations in the BRCA1 gene frequently reveals a missense variant for which the impact on the molecular function of the BRCA1 protein is unknown. Functional BRCA1 is required for homology directed repair (HDR) of double-strand DNA breaks, a key activity for maintaining genome integrity and tumor suppression. Here we describe a multiplex HDR reporter assay to simultaneously measure the effect of hundreds of variants of BRCA1 on its role in DNA repair. Using this assay, we measured the effects of {\textasciitilde}1,700 amino acid substitutions in the first 302 residues of BRCA1. Benchmarking these results against variants with known effects, we demonstrate accurate discrimination of loss-of-function versus benign variants. We anticipate that this assay can be used to functionally characterize BRCA1 missense variants at scale, even before the variants are observed in results from genetic testing.},

Although approximately 1 in 500 people harbor missense variants in PPARG, most are of unknown consequence. To prospectively characterize PPARγ variants, we used highly parallel oligonucleotide synthesis to construct a library encoding all 9,595 possible single–amino acid substitutions. We developed a pooled functional assay in human macrophages, experimentally evaluated all protein variants, and used the experimental data to train a variant classifier by supervised machine learning. When applied to 55 new missense variants identified in population-based and clinical sequencing, the classifier annotated 6 variants as pathogenic; these were subsequently validated by single-variant assays. Saturation mutagenesis and prospective experimental characterization can support immediate diagnostic interpretation of newly discovered missense variants in disease-related genes.},

Here we provide a statistical framework for the analysis of excesses in de novo mutation per gene and gene set by calibrating a model of de novo mutation. We applied this framework to de novo mutations collected from 1,078 ASD family trios, and, whereas we affirmed a significant role for loss-of-function mutations, we found no excess of de novo loss-of-function mutations in cases with IQ above 100, suggesting that the role of de novo mutations in ASDs might reside in fundamental neurodevelopmental processes. We also used our model to identify ∼1,000 genes that are significantly lacking in functional coding variation in non-ASD samples and are enriched for de novo loss-of-function mutations identified in ASD cases.},

In the present study, the functional effects of pathogenic missense mutations on three-dimensional macromolecular complex structures were explored in terms of dominant mutation types, namely, haploinsufficiency, dominant-negative, or toxic gain-of-function. The major types of dominant mutation were significantly associated with the different types of molecular interactions, such as protein-DNA, homo-oligomerization, or intramolecular domain-domain interactions, affected by mutations. The dominant-negative mutations were biased toward molecular interfaces for cognate protein or DNA. The haploinsufficiency mutations were enriched on the DNA interfaces. The gain-of-function mutations were localized to domain-domain interfaces.

Random fluctuations in gene expression lead to wide cell-to-cell differences in RNA and protein counts. Most efforts to understand stochastic gene expression focus on local (intrinisic) fluctuations, which have an exact theoretical representation. However, no framework exists to model global (extrinsic) mechanisms of stochasticity. We address this problem by dissecting the sources of stochasticity that influence the expression of a yeast heat shock gene, SSA1. Our observations suggest that extrinsic stochasticity does not influence every step of gene expression, but rather arises specifically from cell-to-cell differences in the propensity to transcribe RNA. This led us to propose a framework for stochastic gene expression where transcription rates vary globally in combination with local, gene-specific fluctuations in all steps of gene expression. The proposed model better explains total expression stochasticity than the prevailing ON-OFF model and offers transcription as the specific mechanism underlying correlated fluctuations in gene expression.},

Noise, far from just a nuisance, has begun to be appreciated for its essential role in key cellular activities. Noise functions in both microbial and eukaryotic cells, in multicellular development, and in evolution. It enables coordination of gene expression across large regulons, as well as probabilistic differentiation strategies that function across cell populations. At the longest timescales, noise may facilitate evolutionary transitions. Here we review examples and emerging principles that connect noise, the architecture of the gene circuits in which it is present, and the biological functions it enables.

I will then point out the distinction between forward and reverse modeling and focus thereafter on the former. Instead of going into mathematical technicalities about different varieties of models, I will focus on their logical structure, in terms of assumptions and conclusions. A model is a logical machine for deducing the latter from the former. If the model is correct, then, if you believe its assumptions, you must, as a matter of logic, also believe its conclusions. This leads to consideration of the assumptions underlying models. If these are based on fundamental physical laws, then it may be reasonable to treat the model as ‘predictive’, in the sense that it is not subject to falsification and we can rely on its conclusions. However, at the molecular level, models are more often derived from phenomenology and guesswork. In this case, the model is a test of its assumptions and must be falsifiable. I will discuss three models from this perspective, each of which yields biological insights, and this will lead to some guidelines for prospective model builders.},

	abstract = {Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are powerful paradigms for mapping the determinants of gene expression and organismal phenotypes, respectively. However, eQTL mapping and GWAS are limited in scope (to naturally occurring, common genetic variants) and resolution (by linkage disequilibrium). Here, we present crisprQTL mapping, a framework in which large numbers of CRISPR/Cas9 perturbations are introduced to each cell on an isogenic background, followed by single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). crisprQTL mapping is analogous to conventional human eQTL studies, but with individual humans replaced by individual cells; genetic variants replaced by unique combinations of unlinked guide RNA (gRNA)-programmed perturbations per cell; and tissue-level RNA-seq of many individuals replaced by scRNA-seq of many cells. By randomly introducing gRNAs, a single population of cells can be leveraged to test for association between each perturbation and the expression of any potential target gene, analogous to how eQTL studies leverage populations of humans to test millions of genetic variants for associations with expression in a genome-wide manner. However, crisprQTL mapping is neither limited to naturally occurring, common genetic variants nor by linkage disequilibrium. As a proof-of-concept, we applied crisprQTL mapping to evaluate 1,119 candidate enhancers with no strong a priori hypothesis as to their target gene(s). Perturbations were made by a nuclease-dead Cas9 tethered to KRAB, and introduced at a mean "allele frequency" of 1.1\% into a population of 47,650 profiled human K562 cells (median of 15 gRNAs identified per cell). We tested for differential expression of all genes within 1 megabase of each candidate enhancer, effectively evaluating 17,584 potential enhancer-target gene relationships within a single experiment. At an empirical false discovery rate of 10\%, we identify 128 cis crisprQTLs (11\%) whose targeting resulted in downregulation of 105 nearby genes. crisprQTLs were strongly enriched for proximity to their target genes (median 34.3 kilobases) and the strength of H3K27ac, p300, and lineage-specific transcription factor ChIP-seq peaks. Our results establish the power of the eQTL mapping paradigm as applied to programmed variation in populations of cells, rather than natural variation in populations of individuals. We anticipate that crisprQTL mapping will facilitate the comprehensive elucidation of the cis-regulatory architecture of the human genome.},

Despite great progress recently, substantial challenges remain, including discriminating biological variation from technical noise. Here we apply the SMART-seq single-cell RNA-seq protocol to study the reference lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878. By using spike-in quantification standards, we estimate the absolute number of RNA molecules per cell for each gene and find significant variation in total mRNA content: between 50,000 and 300,000 transcripts per cell. We directly measure technical stochasticity by a pool/split design and find that there are significant differences in expression between individual cells, over and above technical variation. Specific gene coexpression modules were preferentially expressed in subsets of individual cells, including one enriched for mRNA processing and splicing factors. We assess cell-to-cell variation in alternative splicing and allelic bias and report evidence of significant differences in splice site usage that exceed splice variation in the pool/split comparison. Finally, we show that transcriptomes from small pools of 30–100 cells approach the information content and reproducibility of contemporary RNA-seq from large amounts of input material. Together, our results define an experimental and computational path forward for analyzing gene expression in rare cell types and cell states.},

The robustness, or uniformity, of an individual’s character is not only of great practical importance in medical genetics and food production but is also of scientific and evolutionary interest (e.g., blood pressure in animal models of heart disease, litter size in pigs, flowering time in plants). We describe a method for detecting major genes controlling the phenotypic variance, referring to these as vQTL. Our method uses a double generalized linear model with linear predictors based on probabilities of line origin. We evaluate our method on simulated F2 and collaborative cross data, and on a real F2 intercross, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness to the presence of ordinary mean-controlling QTL. We also illustrate the connection between vQTL and QTL involved in epistasis, explaining how these concepts overlap. Our method can be applied to a wide range of commonly used experimental crosses and may be extended to genetic association more generally.},

Functionality‐conferring patterns in their protein sequence are inferred through statistical learning. Using yeast HSF1 transcription factor‐based assay, we discovered IDRs that function as transactivation domains (TADs) by screening a random sequence library and a designed library consisting of variants of 13 diverse TADs. Using machine learning, we find that segments devoid of positively charged residues but with redundant short sequence patterns of negatively charged and aromatic residues are a generic feature for TAD functionality. We anticipate that investigating defined sequence libraries using IDR‐Screen for specific functions can facilitate discovering novel and functional regions of the disordered proteome as well as understand the impact of natural and disease variants in disordered segments.

IDR‐Screen is a high‐throughput experimental and computational approach for discovering functional disordered regions in a biologically relevant context and identifying features of functional sequences through statistical learning.

IDR‐Screen allows discovering functional disordered regions and learning what makes them functional.Several new transactivation domains (TAD) are discovered from a library of random sequences and the effect of mutations in 13 naturally occurring TADs from various transcription factors is analyzed.Machine learning algorithms allow identification of features associated with transactivation function and can be used to design new TAD sequences.IDR‐Screen can facilitate identification of functional disordered regions in naturally occurring proteins and help analyze the effect of natural variation and disease mutations within disordered protein regions.},

We propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be explained by effects on genes outside core pathways.

Consequently, divergence in enhancer sequence and activity is thought to be an important mediator of inter- and intra-species phenotypic variation. Here, we give an overview of emerging principles of enhancer function, current models of enhancer architecture, genomic substrates from which enhancers emerge during evolution, and the influence of three-dimensional genome organization on long-range gene regulation. We discuss intricate relationships between distinct elements within complex regulatory landscapes and consider their potential impact on specificity and robustness of transcriptional regulation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Summary{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Critical developmental control genes sometimes contain "shadow" enhancers that can be located in remote positions, including the introns of neighboring genes [1]. They nonetheless produce patterns of gene expression that are the same as or similar to those produced by more proximal primary enhancers. It was suggested that shadow enhancers help foster robustness in gene expression in response to environmental or genetic perturbations [2, 3]. We critically tested this hypothesis by employing a combination of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) recombineering and quantitative confocal imaging methods [2, 4]. Evidence is presented that the \textit{snail} gene is regulated by a distal shadow enhancer located within a neighboring locus. Removal of the proximal primary enhancer does not significantly perturb \textit{snail} function, including the repression of neurogenic genes and formation of the ventral furrow during gastrulation at normal temperatures. However, at elevated temperatures, there is sporadic loss of \textit{snail} expression and coincident disruptions in gastrulation. Similar defects are observed at normal temperatures upon reductions in the levels of Dorsal, a key activator of \textit{snail} expression (reviewed in [5]). These results suggest that shadow enhancers represent a novel mechanism of canalization whereby complex developmental processes "bring about one definite end-result regardless of minor variations in conditions" [6].{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Computational approaches to identify TRNs can be applied in any species where quality RNA can be acquired, However, ChIP-Seq and similar validation methods are challenging to employ in non-model species. Improving the accuracy of computational inference methods can significantly reduce the cost and time of subsequent validation experiments. We have developed ExRANGES, an approach that improves the ability to computationally infer TRN from time series expression data. ExRANGES utilizes both the rate of change in expression and the absolute expression level to identify TRN connections. We evaluated ExRANGES in five data sets from different model systems. ExRANGES improved the identification of experimentally validated transcription factor targets for all species tested, even in unevenly spaced and sparse data sets. This improved ability to predict known regulator-target relationships enhances the utility of network inference approaches in non-model species where experimental validation is challenging. We integrated ExRANGES with two different network construction approaches and it has been implemented as an R package available here:

Although reconstruction of regulatory circuits from genomic data alone is therefore desirable, this remains a major computational challenge. Comparative approaches that examine the conservation and divergence of circuits and their components across strains and species can help reconstruct circuits as well as provide insights into the evolution of gene regulatory processes and their adaptive contribution. In recent years, advances in genomic and computational tools have led to a wealth of methods for such analysis at the sequence, expression, pathway, module, and entire network level. Here, we review computational methods developed to study transcriptional regulatory networks using comparative genomics, from sequence to functional data. We highlight how these methods use evolutionary conservation and divergence to reliably detect regulatory components as well as estimate the extent and rate of divergence. Finally, we discuss the promise and open challenges in linking regulatory divergence to phenotypic divergence and adaptation.},

Because of limitations of classical clustering methods, numerous alternative module detection methods have been proposed, which improve upon clustering by handling co-expression in only a subset of samples, modelling the regulatory network, and/or allowing overlap between modules. In this study we use known regulatory networks to do a comprehensive and robust evaluation of these different methods. Overall, decomposition methods outperform all other strategies, while we do not find a clear advantage of biclustering and network inference-based approaches on large gene expression datasets. Using our evaluation workflow, we also investigate several practical aspects of module detection, such as parameter estimation and the use of alternative similarity measures, and conclude with recommendations for the further development of these methods., Modules composed of groups of genes with similar expression profiles tend to be functionally related and co-regulated.

	abstract = {Summary
Paralogous transcription factors (TFs) are oftentimes reported to have identical DNA-binding motifs, despite the fact that they perform distinct regulatory functions. Differential genomic targeting by paralogous TFs is generally assumed to be due to interactions with protein co-factors or the chromatin environment. Using a computational-experimental framework called iMADS (integrative modeling and analysis of differential specificity), we show that, contrary to previous assumptions, paralogous TFs bind differently to genomic target sites even in vitro. We used iMADS to quantify, model, and analyze specificity differences between 11 TFs from 4 protein families. We found that paralogous TFs have diverged mainly at medium- and low-affinity sites, which are poorly captured by current motif models. We identify sequence and shape features differentially preferred by paralogous TFs, and we show that the intrinsic differences in specificity among paralogous TFs contribute to their differential in vivo binding. Thus, our study represents a step forward in deciphering the molecular mechanisms of differential specificity in TF families.},

	abstract = {While there have been studies exploring regulatory variation in one or more tissues, the complexity of tissue-specificity in multiple primary tissues is not yet well understood. We explore in depth the role of cis-regulatory variation in three human tissues: lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), skin, and fat. The samples (156 LCL, 160 skin, 166 fat) were derived simultaneously from a subset of well-phenotyped healthy female twins of the MuTHER resource. We discover an abundance of cis-eQTLs in each tissue similar to previous estimates (858 or 4.7\% of genes). In addition, we apply factor analysis (FA) to remove effects of latent variables, thus more than doubling the number of our discoveries (1,822 eQTL genes). The unique study design (Matched Co-Twin Analysis—MCTA) permits immediate replication of eQTLs using co-twins (93\%–98\%) and validation of the considerable gain in eQTL discovery after FA correction. We highlight the challenges of comparing eQTLs between tissues. After verifying previous significance threshold-based estimates of tissue-specificity, we show their limitations given their dependency on statistical power. We propose that continuous estimates of the proportion of tissue-shared signals and direct comparison of the magnitude of effect on the fold change in expression are essential properties that jointly provide a biologically realistic view of tissue-specificity. Under this framework we demonstrate that 30\% of eQTLs are shared among the three tissues studied, while another 29\% appear exclusively tissue-specific. However, even among the shared eQTLs, a substantial proportion (10\%–20\%) have significant differences in the magnitude of fold change between genotypic classes across tissues. Our results underline the need to account for the complexity of eQTL tissue-specificity in an effort to assess consequences of such variants for complex traits.},

This approach builds on factor analysis methods that infer broad variance components in the measurements. PEER takes as input transcript profiles and covariates from a set of individuals, and then outputs hidden factors that explain much of the expression variability. Optionally, these factors can be interpreted as pathway or transcription factor activations by providing prior information about which genes are involved in the pathway or targeted by the factor. The inferred factors are used in genetic association analyses. First, they are treated as additional covariates, and are included in the model to increase detection power for mapping expression traits. Second, they are analyzed as phenotypes themselves to understand the causes of global expression variability. PEER extends previous related surrogate variable models and can be implemented within hours on a desktop computer.},

It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

Furthermore, we identified that selection has shaped quantitative variation in yeast sporulation between strains. These results illustrate how genetic interactions between transcription factors are a major source of phenotypic diversity within species.
Adaptive differences in yeast sporulation arise from single-nucleotide mutations in transcription factors regulating sex.

The majority of discoveries have uncovered cis–expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) effects via mass univariate testing of SNPs against gene expression in single tissues. Here we present a Bayesian method for multiple-tissue experiments focusing on uncovering gene networks linked to genetic variation. Our method decomposes the 3D array (or tensor) of gene expression measurements into a set of latent components. We identify sparse gene networks that can then be tested for association against genetic variation across the genome. We apply our method to a data set of 845 individuals from the TwinsUK cohort with gene expression measured via RNA-seq analysis in adipose, lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and skin. We uncover several gene networks with a genetic basis and clear biological and statistical significance. Extensions of this approach will allow integration of different omics, environmental and phenotypic data sets.},

Mutations affecting mitochondria were particularly variable in their outcome. In both mutant and wild-type cells mitochondria state – but not content – varied substantially across individual cells and predicted cell-to-cell variation in proliferation, mutation outcome, stress tolerance, and resistance to a clinically used anti-fungal drug.

However, no similar analysis of population structure in gene expression data has been conducted, in part because a naïve principal components analysis of the gene expression matrix does not cluster by population. We identify a linear projection that reveals population structure in gene expression data. Our approach relies on the coupling of the principal components of genotype to the principal components of gene expression via canonical correlation analysis. Futhermore, we analyze the variance of each gene within the projection matrix to determine which genes significantly influence the projection. We identify thousands of significant genes, and show that a number of the top genes have been implicated in diseases that disproportionately impact African Americans.},

	issn = {1468-4357},
	doi = {10.1093/biostatistics/kxx053},
	abstract = {Until recently, high-throughput gene expression technology, such as RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) required hundreds of thousands of cells to produce reliable measurements. Recent technical advances permit genome-wide gene expression measurement at the single-cell level. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used and numerous publications are based on data produced with this technology. However, RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data are markedly different. In particular, unlike RNA-seq, the majority of reported expression levels in scRNA-seq are zeros, which could be either biologically-driven, genes not expressing RNA at the time of measurement, or technically-driven, genes expressing RNA, but not at a sufficient level to be detected by sequencing technology. Another difference is that the proportion of genes reporting the expression level to be zero varies substantially across single cells compared to RNA-seq samples. However, it remains unclear to what extent this cell-to-cell variation is being driven by technical rather than biological variation. Furthermore, while systematic errors, including batch effects, have been widely reported as a major challenge in high-throughput technologies, these issues have received minimal attention in published studies based on scRNA-seq technology. Here, we use an assessment experiment to examine data from published studies and demonstrate that systematic errors can explain a substantial percentage of observed cell-to-cell expression variability. Specifically, we present evidence that some of these reported zeros are driven by technical variation by demonstrating that scRNA-seq produces more zeros than expected and that this bias is greater for lower expressed genes. In addition, this missing data problem is exacerbated by the fact that this technical variation varies cell-to-cell. Then, we show how this technical cell-to-cell variability can be confused with novel biological results. Finally, we demonstrate and discuss how batch-effects and confounded experiments can intensify the problem.},

This induces quantitative correlations in the expression of functionally related genes such as those involved in the Msn2/4 stress response pathway, amino-acid biosynthesis, and mitochondrial maintenance. Bioinformatic analyses and genetic perturbations suggest that fluctuations in PKA and Tor signaling contribute to pathway-specific variability. Our results argue that a limited number of well-delineated “noise regulons” operate across a yeast cell, and that such coordinated fluctuations enable a stochastic but coherent induction of functionally related genes.

We examined the variation in the expression levels of 43 Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins, in cells grown under 11 experimental conditions. For all classes of genes and under all conditions, the expression variance was approximately proportional to the mean; the same scaling was observed at steady state and during the transient responses to the perturbations. Theoretical analysis suggests that this scaling behavior reflects variability in mRNA copy number, resulting from random 'birth and death' of mRNA molecules or from promoter fluctuations. Deviation of coexpressed genes from this general trend, including high noise in stress-related genes and low noise in proteasomal genes, may indicate fluctuations in pathway-specific regulators or a differential activation pattern of the underlying gene promoters.},

We found that the major source of variation in the gene expression data was driven by genotype, but we also observed substantial variation between the technical replicates. We observed that the conversion of reads to molecules using the UMIs was impacted by both biological and technical variation, indicating that UMI counts are not an unbiased estimator of gene expression levels.

Every time a cell divides, it is faced with the problem of ensuring adequate distribution of all components to the daughter cells. This includes components that are present in relatively small numbers, like the mitochondria and their DNA-containing nucleoids. Jajoo et al. used quantitative time-lapse fluorescence microscopy of single yeast cells to explore how this works. Unlike chromosomes or macromolecules, mitochondria and nucleoids are distributed in proportion to the volume of cytoplasm received by each daughter cell. Partitioning errors are kept low by even distribution of the mitochondrial volume and roughly equal spacing of the nucleoids before they are distributed.
Science, this issue p. 169
All cellular materials are partitioned between daughters at cell division, but by various mechanisms and with different accuracy. In the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the mitochondria are pushed to the cell poles by the spindle. We found that mitochondria spatially reequilibrate just before division, and that the mitochondrial volume and DNA-containing nucleoids instead segregate in proportion to the cytoplasm inherited by each daughter. However, nucleoid partitioning errors are suppressed by control at two levels: Mitochondrial volume is actively distributed throughout a cell, and nucleoids are spaced out in semiregular arrays within mitochondria. During the cell cycle, both mitochondria and nucleoids appear to be produced without feedback, creating a net control of fluctuations that is just accurate enough to avoid substantial growth defects.
Daughter cells get their fair share of mitochondria.

The position effects are signiﬁcant, altering the mean protein expression level by up to 15 times and expression noise by up to 20 times. DNA replication timing, 3D chromosomal conformation, and several histone modiﬁcations are major covariates of position effects. Essential genes are enriched in genomic regions with inherently low expression noise, supporting the hypothesis that chromosomal clustering of essential genes results from selection against their expressional stochasticity. Position effects exhibit signiﬁcant interactions with promoters. Together, our results suggest that position effects have shaped the evolution of chromosome organization and should inform future genome engineering efforts.},

A more complete understanding of the causes and effects of cell-cell variability in gene expression is needed to elucidate whether the resulting phenotypes are disadvantageous or confer some adaptive advantage. Here we show that increased variability in gene expression, affected by the sequence of the TATA box, can be beneficial after an acute change in environmental conditions. We rationally introduce mutations within the TATA region of an engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL1 promoter and measure promoter responses that can be characterized as being either highly variable and rapid or steady and slow. We computationally illustrate how a stable transcription scaffold can result in “bursts” of gene expression, enabling rapid individual cell responses in the transient and increased cell-cell variability at steady state. We experimentally verify computational predictions that the rapid response and increased cell-cell variability enabled by TATA-containing promoters confer a clear benefit in the face of an acute environmental stress.},

Here we show in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that stochasticity (noise) arising from transcription contributes significantly to the level of heterogeneity within a eukaryotic clonal population, in contrast to observations in prokaryotes15, and that such noise can be modulated at the translational level. We use a stochastic model of transcription initiation specific to eukaryotes to show that pulsatile mRNA production, through reinitiation, is crucial for the dependence of noise on transcriptional efficiency, highlighting a key difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic sources of noise. Furthermore, we explore the propagation of noise in a gene cascade network and demonstrate experimentally that increased noise in the transcription of a regulatory protein leads to increased cell–cell variability in the target gene output, resulting in prolonged bistable expression states. This result has implications for the role of noise in phenotypic variation and cellular differentiation.},

Here, we present a high-throughput method for measuring promoter-driven noise for thousands of designed synthetic promoters in parallel. We use it to investigate how promoters encode different noise levels and find that the noise levels of promoters with similar mean expression levels can vary more than one order of magnitude, with nucleosome-disfavoring sequences resulting in lower noise and more transcription factor binding sites resulting in higher noise. We propose a kinetic model of gene expression that takes into account the nonspecific DNA binding and one-dimensional sliding along the DNA, which occurs when transcription factors search for their target sites. We show that this assumption can improve the prediction of the mean-independent component of expression noise for our designed promoter sequences, suggesting that a transcription factor target search may affect gene expression noise. Consistent with our findings in designed promoters, we find that binding-site multiplicity in native promoters is associated with higher expression noise. Overall, our results demonstrate that small changes in promoter DNA sequence can tune noise levels in a manner that is predictable and partly decoupled from effects on the mean expression levels. These insights may assist in designing promoters with desired noise levels.},

The fly retina contains two types of ommatidia, called ‘pale’ and ‘yellow’, defined by different rhodopsin pairs expressed in R7 and R8 cells. Similar to the human cone photoreceptors, these ommatidial subtypes are distributed stochastically in the retina. The choice between pale versus yellow ommatidia is made in R7 cells, which then impose their fate onto R8. Here we report that the Drosophila dioxin receptor Spineless is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of the ommatidial mosaic. A short burst of spineless expression at mid-pupation in a large subset of R7 cells precedes rhodopsin expression. In spineless mutants, all R7 and most R8 cells adopt the pale fate, whereas overexpression of spineless is sufficient to induce the yellow R7 fate. Therefore, this study suggests that the entire retinal mosaic required for colour vision is defined by the stochastic expression of a single transcription factor, Spineless.},

Noise in cellular physiology plays an important role in many fundamental cellular processes, including transcription, translation, stem cell differentiation and response to medication, but the specific random influences that affect these processes have yet to be clearly elucidated. Here we present a mechanism by which variability in mitochondrial volume and functionality, along with cell cycle dynamics, is linked to variability in transcription rate and hence has a profound effect on downstream cellular processes. Our model mechanism is supported by an appreciable volume of recent experimental evidence, and we present the results of several new experiments with which our model is also consistent. We find that noise due to mitochondrial variability can sometimes dominate over other extrinsic noise sources (such as cell cycle asynchronicity) and can significantly affect large-scale observable properties such as cell cycle length and gene expression levels. We also explore two recent regulatory network-based models for stem cell differentiation, and find that extrinsic noise in transcription rate causes appreciable variability in the behaviour of these model systems. These results suggest that mitochondrial and transcriptional variability may be an important mechanism influencing a large variety of cellular processes and properties.},

Increasing experimental evidence suggests that genome-wide cellular constraints largely contribute to the heterogeneity observed in gene products. It is still unclear, however, which global factors affect gene expression noise and to what extent. Since eukaryotic gene expression is an energy demanding process, differences in the energy budget of each cell could determine gene expression differences. Here, we quantify the contribution of mitochondrial variability (a natural source of ATP variation) to global variability in gene expression. We find that changes in mitochondrial content can account for ∼50\% of the variability observed in protein levels. This is the combined result of the effect of mitochondria dosage on transcription and translation apparatus content and activities. Moreover, we find that mitochondrial levels have a large impact on alternative splicing, thus modulating both the abundance and type of mRNAs. A simple mathematical model in which mitochondrial content simultaneously affects transcription rate and splicing site choice can explain the alternative splicing data. The results of this study show that mitochondrial content (and/or probably function) influences mRNA abundance, translation, and alternative splicing, which ultimately affects cellular phenotype.},

We showed that ND6 mtRNA is localized within mitochondria and concentrated particularly on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).

	abstract = {Renewable in vitro cell cultures, such as lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), have facilitated studies that contributed to our understanding of genetic influence on human traits. However, the degree to which cell lines faithfully maintain differences in donor-specific phenotypes is still debated. We have previously reported that standard cell line maintenance practice results in a loss of donor-specific gene expression signatures in LCLs. An alternative to the LCL model is the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) system, which carries the potential to model tissue-specific physiology through the use of differentiation protocols. Still, existing LCL banks represent an important source of starting material for iPSC generation, and it is possible that the disruptions in gene regulation associated with long-term LCL maintenance could persist through the reprogramming process. To address this concern, we studied the effect of reprogramming mature LCL cultures from six unrelated donors to iPSCs on the ensuing gene expression patterns within and between individuals. We show that the reprogramming process results in a recovery of donor-specific gene regulatory signatures, increasing the number of genes with a detectable donor effect by an order of magnitude. The proportion of variation in gene expression statistically attributed to donor increases from 6.9\% in LCLs to 24.5\% in iPSCs (P {\textless} 10-15). Since environmental contributions are unlikely to be a source of individual variation in our system of highly passaged cultured cell lines, our observations suggest that the effect of genotype on gene regulation is more pronounced in iPSCs than in LCLs. Our findings indicate that iPSCs can be a powerful model system for studies of phenotypic variation across individuals in general, and the genetic association with variation in gene regulation in particular. We further conclude that LCLs are an appropriate starting material for iPSC generation.},

Membrane-potential-dependent dyes such as Rhodamine 123, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) are useful as long as the mitochondrion maintains its negative membrane potential. MitoTracker is a commercially available fluorescent dye (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes) that, like the aforementioned dyes, labels mitochondria within live cells utilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential. However, MitoTracker is chemically reactive, linking to thiol groups in the mitochondria. The dye becomes permanently bound to the mitochondria, and thus remains after the cell dies or is fixed. In addition, it can be used in experiments in which multiple labeling diminishes mitochondrial function. This protocol describes the labeling of mitochondria in live and fixed cells with MitoTracker dyes.},

How precisely the transcription machinery fulfills this task is not known. Using an in situ hybridization approach that detects single mRNA molecules, we measured mRNA abundance and transcriptional activity within single Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. We found that expression levels for particular genes are higher than initially reported and can vary substantially among cells. However, variability for most constitutively expressed genes is unexpectedly small. Combining single-transcript measurements with computational modeling indicates that low expression variation is achieved by transcribing genes using single transcription-initiation events that are clearly separated in time, rather than by transcriptional bursts. In contrast, PDR5, a gene regulated by the transcription coactivator complex SAGA, is expressed using transcription bursts, resulting in larger variation. These data directly demonstrate the existence of multiple expression modes used to modulate the transcriptome.},

	abstract = {Variation among individuals arises in part from differences in DNA sequences, but the genetic basis for variation in most traits, including common diseases, remains only partly understood. Many DNA variants influence phenotypes by altering the expression level of one or several genes. The effects of such variants can be detected as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)1. Traditional eQTL mapping requires large-scale genotype and gene expression data for each individual in the study sample, which limits sample sizes to hundreds of individuals in both humans and model organisms and reduces statistical power2,3,4,5,6. Consequently, many eQTL are probably missed, especially those with smaller effects7. Furthermore, most studies use messenger RNA rather than protein abundance as the measure of gene expression. Studies that have used mass-spectrometry proteomics8,9,10,11,12,13 reported unexpected differences between eQTL and protein QTL (pQTL) for the same genes9,10, but these studies have been even more limited in scope. Here we introduce a powerful method for identifying genetic loci that influence protein expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We measure single-cell protein abundance through the use of green fluorescent protein tags in very large populations of genetically variable cells, and use pooled sequencing to compare allele frequencies across the genome in thousands of individuals with high versus low protein abundance. We applied this method to 160 genes and detected many more loci per gene than previous studies. We also observed closer correspondence between loci that influence protein abundance and loci that influence mRNA abundance of a given gene. Most loci that we detected were clustered in ‘hotspots’ that influence multiple proteins, and some hotspots were found to influence more than half of the proteins that we examined. The variants that underlie these hotspots have profound effects on the gene regulatory network and provide insights into genetic variation in cell physiology between yeast strains.},

These new technologies have added a new genome wide molecular dimension to the description of cell type, with genome-wide expression and epigenetic data acting as a cell type ‘fingerprint’ to describe the cell state. Using these genomic fingerprints cell types are being increasingly defined based on specific genomic and molecular criteria, without necessarily a distinct biological function. In this review, we will discuss the molecular definitions of cell types and cell type control, and particularly how endogenous and exogenous transcription factors can control cell types and cell type conversions.},

Here we use an analytic model to investigate the emergent noise properties of genetic systems. We find for a single gene that noise is essentially determined at the translational level, and that the mean and variance of protein concentration can be independently controlled. The noise strength immediately following single gene induction is almost twice the final steady-state value. We find that fluctuations in the concentrations of a regulatory protein can propagate through a genetic cascade; translational noise control could explain the inefficient translation rates observed for genes encoding such regulatory proteins. For an autoregulatory protein, we demonstrate that negative feedback efficiently decreases system noise. The model can be used to predict the noise characteristics of networks of arbitrary connectivity. The general procedure is further illustrated for an autocatalytic protein and a bistable genetic switch. The analysis of intrinsic noise reveals biological roles of gene network structures and can lead to a deeper understanding of their evolutionary origin.},

Recent studies have demonstrated strong purifying selection in the mouse female germline3,4. However, the mechanisms underlying positive selection of healthy mitochondria remain to be elucidated. We visualized mtDNA replication during Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis, finding that mtDNA replication commenced before oocyte determination during the late germarium stage and was dependent on mitochondrial fitness. We isolated a temperature-sensitive lethal mtDNA allele, mt:CoIT300I, which resulted in reduced mtDNA replication in the germarium at the restrictive temperature. Additionally, the frequency of the mt:CoIT300I allele in heteroplasmic flies was decreased, both during oogenesis and over multiple generations, at the restrictive temperature. Furthermore, we determined that selection against mt:CoIT300I overlaps with the timing of selective replication of mtDNA in the germarium. These findings establish a previously uncharacterized developmental mechanism for the selective amplification of wild-type mtDNA, which may be evolutionarily conserved to limit the transmission of deleterious mutations.},

Genetically identical populations of cells grown in the same environmental condition show substantial variability in gene expression profiles. Although single-cell RNA-seq provides an opportunity to explore this phenomenon, statistical methods need to be developed to interpret the variability of gene expression counts.

Results
We develop a statistical framework for studying the kinetics of stochastic gene expression from single-cell RNA-seq data. By applying our model to a single-cell RNA-seq dataset generated by profiling mouse embryonic stem cells, we find that the inferred kinetic parameters are consistent with RNA polymerase II binding and chromatin modifications. Our results suggest that histone modifications affect transcriptional bursting by modulating both burst size and frequency. Furthermore, we show that our model can be used to identify genes with slow promoter kinetics, which are important for probabilistic differentiation of embryonic stem cells.

Conclusions
We conclude that the proposed statistical model provides a flexible and efficient way to investigate the kinetics of transcription.},

	abstract = {Genetic variation segregating within a species reflects the combined activities of mutation, selection, and genetic drift. In the absence of selection, polymorphisms are expected to be a random subset of new mutations; thus, comparing the effects of polymorphisms and new mutations provides a test for selection–. When evidence of selection exists, such comparisons can identify properties of mutations that are most likely to persist in natural populations. Here, we investigate how mutation and selection have shaped variation in a cis-regulatory sequence controlling gene expression by empirically determining the effects of polymorphisms segregating in the TDH3 promoter among 85 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and comparing their effects to a distribution of mutational effects defined by 236 point mutations in the same promoter. Surprisingly, we find that selection on expression noise (i.e., variability in expression among genetically identical cells) appears to have had a greater impact on sequence variation in the TDH3 promoter than selection on mean expression level. This is not necessarily because variation in expression noise impacts fitness more than variation in mean expression level, but rather because of differences in the distributions of mutational effects for these two phenotypes. This study shows how systematically examining the effects of new mutations can enrich our understanding of evolutionary mechanisms and provides rare empirical evidence of selection acting on expression noise.},

Alternative scenarios have been proposed, in which the kinetics of transcription are governed by cellular constraints and follow universal rules across the genome. Evidence from genome-wide noise studies and from systematic perturbations of promoter sequences suggest that both scenarios-namely gene-specific versus genome-wide regulation of transcription kinetics-may be present to different degrees in bacteria, yeast, and animal cells.},

	abstract = {Cell-to-cell variance in protein levels (noise) is a ubiquitous phenomenon that can increase fitness by generating phenotypic differences within clonal populations of cells. An important challenge is to identify the specific molecular events that control noise. This task is complicated by the strong dependence of a protein’s cell-to-cell variance on its mean expression level through a power-law like relationship (s2/m1.69). Here, we dissect the nature of this relationship using a stochastic model parameterized with experimentally measured values. This framework naturally recapitulates the power-law like relationship (s2/m1.6) and accurately predicts protein variance across the yeast proteome (r2 = 0.935). Using this model we identified two distinct mechanisms by which protein variance can be increased. Variables that affect promoter activation, such as nucleosome positioning, increase protein variance by changing the exponent of the power-law relationship. In contrast, variables that affect processes downstream of promoter activation, such as mRNA and protein synthesis, increase protein variance in a mean-dependent manner following the power-law. We verified our findings experimentally using an inducible gene expression system in yeast. We conclude that the power-law-like relationship between noise and protein mean is due to the kinetics of promoter activation. Our results provide a framework for understanding how molecular processes shape stochastic variation across the genome.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic cell-to-cell variability within clonal populations may be a manifestation of ‘gene expression noise’1,2,3,4,5,6, or it may reflect stable phenotypic variants7. Such ‘non-genetic cell individuality’7 can arise from the slow fluctuations of protein levels8 in mammalian cells. These fluctuations produce persistent cell individuality, thereby rendering a clonal population heterogeneous. However, it remains unknown whether this heterogeneity may account for the stochasticity of cell fate decisions in stem cells. Here we show that in clonal populations of mouse haematopoietic progenitor cells, spontaneous ‘outlier’ cells with either extremely high or low expression levels of the stem cell marker Sca-1 (also known as Ly6a; ref. 9) reconstitute the parental distribution of Sca-1 but do so only after more than one week. This slow relaxation is described by a gaussian mixture model that incorporates noise-driven transitions between discrete subpopulations, suggesting hidden multi-stability within one cell type. Despite clonality, the Sca-1 outliers had distinct transcriptomes. Although their unique gene expression profiles eventually reverted to that of the median cells, revealing an attractor state, they lasted long enough to confer a greatly different proclivity for choosing either the erythroid or the myeloid lineage. Preference in lineage choice was associated with increased expression of lineage-specific transcription factors, such as a {\textgreater}200-fold increase in Gata1 (ref. 10) among the erythroid-prone cells, or a {\textgreater}15-fold increased PU.1 (Sfpi1) (ref. 11) expression among myeloid-prone cells. Thus, clonal heterogeneity of gene expression level is not due to independent noise in the expression of individual genes, but reflects metastable states of a slowly fluctuating transcriptome that is distinct in individual cells and may govern the reversible, stochastic priming of multipotent progenitor cells in cell fate decision.},

However, it is currently unclear what genomic features control variation in gene expression levels, and whether common genetic variants may impact gene expression variation. Here, we take a genome-wide approach to identify expression variance quantitative trait loci (vQTLs). To this end, we generated single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from 53 Yoruba individuals. We collected data for a median of 95 cells per individual and a total of 5,447 single cells, and identified 241 mean expression QTLs (eQTLs) at 10\% FDR, of which 82\% replicate in bulk RNA-seq data from the same individuals. We further identified 14 vQTLs at 10\% FDR, but demonstrate that these can also be explained as effects on mean expression. Our study suggests that dispersion QTLs (dQTLs) which could alter the variance of expression independently of the mean can have larger fold changes, but explain less phenotypic variance than eQTLs. We estimate 424 individuals as a lower bound to achieve 80\% power to detect the strongest dQTLs in iPSCs. These results will guide the design of future studies on understanding the genetic control of gene expression variance.},

	abstract = {The genetic control of common traits is rarely deterministic, with many genes contributing only to the chance of developing a given phenotype. This incomplete penetrance is poorly understood and is usually attributed to interactions between genes or interactions between genes and environmental conditions. Because many traits such as cancer can emerge from rare events happening in one or very few cells, we speculate an alternative and complementary possibility where some genotypes could facilitate these events by increasing stochastic cell-to-cell variations (or ‘noise’). As a very first step towards investigating this possibility, we studied how natural genetic variation influences the level of noise in the expression of a single gene using the yeast S. cerevisiae as a model system. Reproducible differences in noise were observed between divergent genetic backgrounds. We found that noise was highly heritable and placed under a complex genetic control. Scanning the genome, we mapped three Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) of noise, one locus being explained by an increase in noise when transcriptional elongation was impaired. Our results suggest that the level of stochasticity in particular molecular regulations may differ between multicellular individuals depending on their genotypic background. The complex genetic architecture of noise buffering couples genetic to non-genetic robustness and provides a molecular basis to the probabilistic nature of complex traits.},

The switching between these states has long been understood as a transition between attractor states of a molecular network.

Methodology/Principal Findings We present a novel mathematical concept in which stem cell and progenitor population dynamics are described as a probabilistic process that arises from cell proliferation and small fluctuations in the state of differentiation. These state fluctuations reflect random transitions between different activation patterns of the underlying regulatory network. Importantly, the associated noise amplitudes are state-dependent and set by the environment. Their variability determines the attractor states, and thus actually governs population dynamics. This model quantitatively reproduces the observed dynamics of differentiation and dedifferentiation in promyelocytic precursor cells. Conclusions/Significance Consequently, state-specific noise modulation by external signals can be instrumental in controlling stem cell and progenitor population dynamics. We propose follow-up experiments for quantifying the imprinting influence of the environment on cellular noise regulation.},

Cell-to-cell variability of gene expression in clonal populations of mammalian cells is ubiquitous. However, because molecular biologists habitually assume uniformity of the cell populations that serve as starting material for experimental analysis, attention to such non-genetic heterogeneity has been scant. As awareness of, and interest in, understanding its biological significance increases, this Primer attempts to clarify the confusing terminologies used in an emerging field that often conflates heterogeneity with noise, and provides a qualitative introduction to the fundamental dynamic principles that underlie heterogeneity.

However, such simple 1:1 mapping must now give place to the modern concepts of gene regulatory networks and gene expression noise. Both can, in the absence of genetic mutations, jointly generate a diversity of inheritable randomly occupied phenotypic states that could also serve as a substrate for natural selection. This form of epigenetic dynamics challenges Neo-Darwinism. It needs to incorporate the non-linear, stochastic dynamics of gene networks. A first step is to consider the mathematical correspondence between gene regulatory networks and Waddington's metaphoric ‘epigenetic landscape’, which actually represents the quasi-potential function of global network dynamics. It explains the coexistence of multiple stable phenotypes within one genotype. The landscape's topography with its attractors is shaped by evolution through mutational re-wiring of regulatory interactions – offering a link between genetic mutation and sudden, broad evolutionary changes.},

	abstract = {Current investigation of cancer progression towards increasing malignancy focuses on the molecular pathways that produce the various cancerous traits of cells. Their acquisition is explained by the somatic mutation theory: tumor progression is the result of a neo-Darwinian evolution in the tissue. Herein cells are the units of selection. Random genetic mutations permanently affecting these pathways create malignant cell phenotypes that are selected for in the disturbed tissue. However, could it be that the capacity of the genome and its gene regulatory network to generate the vast diversity of cell types during development, i.e., to produce inheritable phenotypic changes without mutations, is harnessed by tumorigenesis to propel a directional change towards malignancy? Here we take an encompassing perspective, transcending the orthodoxy of molecular carcinogenesis and review mechanisms of somatic evolution beyond the Neo-Darwinian scheme. We discuss the central concept of “cancer attractors” – the hidden stable states of gene regulatory networks normally not occupied by cells. Noise-induced transitions into such attractors provide a source for randomness (chance) and regulatory constraints (necessity) in the acquisition of novel expression profiles that can be inherited across cell divisions, and hence, can be selected for. But attractors can also be reached in response to environmental signals – thus offering the possibility for inheriting acquired traits that can also be selected for. Therefore, we face the possibility of non-genetic (mutation-independent) equivalents to both Darwinian and Lamarckian evolution which may jointly explain the arrow of change pointing toward increasing malignancy.},

How cells adopt a particular fate is usually thought of as being deterministic, and in the large majority of cases it is. That is, cells acquire their fate by virtue of their lineage or their proximity to an inductive signal from another cell. In some cases, however, and in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans, cells choose one or another pathway of differentiation stochastically, without apparent regard to environment or history. Stochasticity has important mechanistic requirements. We speculate on why stochasticity is advantageous—and even critical in some circumstances—to the individual, the colony, or the species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cell differentiation has long been theorized to represent a switch in a bistable system, and recent experimental work in micro-organisms has revealed bistable dynamics in small gene regulatory circuits. However, the dynamics of mammalian cell differentiation has not been analyzed with respect to bistability.
RESULTS: Here we studied how HL60 promyelocytic precursor cells transition to the neutrophil cell lineage after stimulation with the differentiation inducer, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Single cell analysis of the expression kinetics of the differentiation marker CD11b (Mac-1) revealed all-or-none switch-like behavior, in contrast to the seemingly graduated change of expression when measured as a population average. Progression from the precursor to the differentiated state was detected as a discrete transition between low (CD11bLow) and high (CD11bHigh) expressor subpopulations distinguishable in a bimodal distribution. Hysteresis in the dependence of CD11b expression on DMSO dose suggests that this bimodality may reflect a bistable dynamic. But when an "unswitched" (CD11bLow) subpopulation of cells in the bistable/bimodal regime was isolated and cultured, these cells were found to differ from undifferentiated precursor cells in that they were "primed" to differentiate.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that differentiation of human HL60 cells into neutrophils does not result from a simple state transition of a bistable switch as traditionally modeled. Instead, mammalian differentiation appears to be a multi-step process in a high-dimensional system, a result which is consistent with the high connectivity of the cells' complex underlying gene regulatory network.},

The ability to adapt to stimuli is a defining feature of many biological systems and critical to maintaining homeostasis. While it is well appreciated that negative feedback can be used to achieve homeostasis when networks behave deterministically, the effect of noise on their regulatory function is not understood. Here, we combine probability and control theory to develop a theory of biological regulation that explicitly takes into account the noisy nature of biochemical reactions. We introduce tools for the analysis and design of robust homeostatic circuits and propose a new regulation motif, which we call antithetic integral feedback. This motif exploits stochastic noise, allowing it to achieve precise regulation in scenarios where similar deterministic regulation fails. Specifically, antithetic integral feedback preserves the stability of the overall network, steers the population of any regulated species to a desired set point, and adapts perfectly. We suggest that this motif may be prevalent in endogenous biological circuits and useful when creating synthetic circuits.},

The application of these methodologies to cell fate reprogramming holds particular promise as the manipulation of cell identity is typically inefficient, generating heterogeneous cell populations. One current limitation of single-cell approaches is that lineage relationships are lost as a result of cell processing, restricting interpretations of the data collected. Here, we present a single-cell resolution lineage-tracing approach based on the combinatorial indexing of cells, ‘CellTagging’. Application of this method, in concert with high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing, reveals the transcriptional dynamics of direct reprogramming from fibroblasts to induced endoderm progenitors. These analyses demonstrate that while many cells initiate reprogramming, complete silencing of fibroblast identity and transition to a progenitor-like state represents a rare event. Clonal analyses uncover a remarkable degree of heterogeneity arising from individual cells. Overall, very few cells fully reprogram to generate expanded populations with a low degree of clonal diversity. Extended culture of these engineered cells reveals an instability of the reprogrammed state and reversion to a fibroblast-like phenotype. Together, these results demonstrate the utility of our lineage-tracing approach to reveal dynamics of lineage reprogramming, and will be of broad utility in many cell biological applications.},

In this context, fundamental questions arise: how can the architecture of gene regulatory networks generate, make use of or be constrained by expression noise? Here, we discuss the interplay between expression noise and gene regulatory network at different levels of organization, ranging from a single regulatory interaction to entire regulatory networks. We then consider how this interplay impacts a variety of phenomena, such as pathogenicity, disease, adaptation to changing environments, differential cell-fate outcome and incomplete or partial penetrance effects. Finally, we highlight recent technological developments that permit measurements at the single-cell level, and discuss directions for future research.},

The small contribution sometimes corresponds to incomplete penetrance, which may result from probabilistic effects on molecular regulations. In such cases, genetic mapping may benefit from the wealth of data produced by single-cell technologies. We present here the development of a novel genetic mapping method that allows to scan genomes for single-cell Probabilistic Trait Loci that modify the statistical properties of cellular-level quantitative traits. Phenotypic values are acquired on thousands of individual cells, and genetic association is obtained from a multivariate analysis of a matrix of Kantorovich distances. No prior assumption is required on the mode of action of the genetic loci involved and, by exploiting all single-cell values, the method can reveal non-deterministic effects. Using both simulations and yeast experimental datasets, we show that it can detect linkages that are missed by classical genetic mapping. A probabilistic effect of a single SNP on cell shape was detected and validated. The method also detected a novel locus associated with elevated gene expression noise of the yeast galactose regulon. Our results illustrate how single-cell technologies can be exploited to improve the genetic dissection of certain common traits. The method is available as an open source R package called ptlmapper.},

Additional inhibition of the p53/p21 pathway or overexpression of Lin28 increased the cell division rate and resulted in an accelerated kinetics of iPS cell formation that was directly proportional to the increase in cell proliferation. In contrast, Nanog overexpression accelerated reprogramming in a predominantly cell-division-rate-independent manner. Quantitative analyses define distinct cell-division-rate-dependent and -independent modes for accelerating the stochastic course of reprogramming, and suggest that the number of cell divisions is a key parameter driving epigenetic reprogramming to pluripotency.},

To address this challenge, we developed a CRISPR-Cas9-based high-throughput genome editing approach that can introduce thousands of specific genetic variants in a single experiment. This enabled us to study the fitness consequences of 16,006 natural genetic variants in yeast. We identified 572 variants with significant fitness differences in glucose media; these are highly enriched in promoters, particularly in transcription factor binding sites, while only 19.2\% affect amino acid sequences. Strikingly, nearby variants nearly always favor the same parent's alleles, suggesting that lineage-specific selection is often driven by multiple clustered variants.

Leveraging the extensive knowledge of yeast transcriptional regulation, we uncovered significant regulatory variation in individual yeast cells, both before and after stress. We also discovered that a subset of cells appears to decouple expression of ribosomal protein genes from the environmental stress response in a manner partly correlated with the cell cycle but unrelated to the yeast ultradian metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging of cells expressing pairs of fluorescent regulators, including the transcription factor Msn2 with Dot6, Sfp1, or MAP kinase Hog1, revealed both coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Together with transcriptomic analysis, our results suggest that cells maintain a cellular filter against decoupled bursts of transcription factor activation but mount a stress response upon coordinated regulation, even in a subset of unstressed cells.},

The observed fluctuations are not due to the low number of molecules expressed from a gene per se but originate in the random, rare events of gene activation. The frequency of these events and the correlation between stochastic expressions of genes in a single cell depend on the positioning of the genes along the chromosomes. Transcriptional regulators produced by such random expression propagate noise to their target genes.},

	abstract = {There are two fundamental ways to view coupled systems of chemical equations:  as continuous, represented by differential equations whose variables are concentrations, or as discrete, represented by stochastic processes whose variables are numbers of molecules. Although the former is by far more common, systems with very small numbers of molecules are important in some applications (e.g., in small biological cells or in surface processes). In both views, most complicated systems with multiple reaction channels and multiple chemical species cannot be solved analytically. There are exact numerical simulation methods to simulate trajectories of discrete, stochastic systems, (methods that are rigorously equivalent to the Master Equation approach) but these do not scale well to systems with many reaction pathways. This paper presents the Next Reaction Method, an exact algorithm to simulate coupled chemical reactions that is also efficient:  it (a) uses only a single random number per simulation event, and (b) takes time proportional to the logarithm of the number of reactions, not to the number of reactions itself. The Next Reaction Method is extended to include time-dependent rate constants and non-Markov processes and is applied to a sample application in biology (the lysis/lysogeny decision circuit of lambda phage). The performance of the Next Reaction Method on this application is compared with one standard method and an optimized version of that standard method.},

In theory, expression noise can also be elevated by natural selection when noisy gene expression is advantageous. Here we analyze yeast genome-wide gene expression noise data and show that plasma-membrane transporters show significantly elevated expression noise after controlling all confounding factors. We propose a model that explains why and under what conditions elevated expression noise may be beneficial and subject to positive selection. Our model predicts and the simulation confirms that, under certain conditions, expression noise also increases the evolvability of gene expression by promoting the fixation of favorable expression level-altering mutations. Indeed, yeast genes with higher noise show greater between-strain and between-species divergences in expression, even when all confounding factors are excluded. Together, our theoretical model and empirical results suggest that, for yeast genes such as plasma-membrane transporters, elevated expression noise is advantageous, is subject to positive selection, and is a facilitator of adaptive gene expression evolution.},

These methods exploit sequence composition, species abundance, or chromosome organization but cannot fully distinguish closely related species and strains. We present a binning method that incorporates bacterial DNA methylation signatures, which are detected using single-molecule real-time sequencing. Our method takes advantage of these endogenous epigenetic barcodes to resolve individual reads and assembled contigs into species- and strain-level bins. We validate our method using synthetic and real microbiome sequences. In addition to genome binning, we show that our method links plasmids and other mobile genetic elements to their host species in a real microbiome sample. Incorporation of DNA methylation information into shotgun metagenomics analyses will complement existing methods to enable more accurate sequence binning.},

Here, we quantify the fitness effects of altering expression noise for the TDH3 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that increases in expression noise can be deleterious or beneficial depending on the difference between the average expression level of a genotype and the expression level maximizing fitness. We also show that a simple model relating single-cell expression levels to population growth produces patterns consistent with our empirical data. We use this model to explore a broad range of average expression levels and expression noise, providing additional insight into the fitness effects of variation in expression noise.},

It would be particularly useful to systematically assay protein subcellular localization, posttranslational modiﬁcations and protein–protein interactions, both at steady state and in response to environmental stimuli. Development of new reagents and methods will enhance our ability to do so efﬁciently and systematically. Here we describe the construction of two collections of budding yeast strains that facilitate proteomewide measurements of protein properties. These collections consist of strains with an epitope tag integrated at the C-terminus of essentially every open reading frame (ORF), one with the tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation (TAP) tag, and one with the green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) tag. We show that in both of these collections we have accurately tagged a high proportion of all ORFs (approximately 75\% of the proteome) by conﬁrming expression of the fusion proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of the TAP collection in performing high-throughput immunoprecipitation experiments. Building on these collections and the methods described in this paper, we hope that the yeast community will expand both the quantity and type of proteome level data available.

	abstract = {The availability of complete genomic sequences and technologies that allow comprehensive analysis of global expression profiles of messenger RNA1,2,3 have greatly expanded our ability to monitor the internal state of a cell. Yet biological systems ultimately need to be explained in terms of the activity, regulation and modification of proteins—and the ubiquitous occurrence of post-transcriptional regulation makes mRNA an imperfect proxy for such information. To facilitate global protein analyses, we have created a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fusion library where each open reading frame is tagged with a high-affinity epitope and expressed from its natural chromosomal location. Through immunodetection of the common tag, we obtain a census of proteins expressed during log-phase growth and measurements of their absolute levels.

The abundance of proteins ranges from fewer than 50 to more than 106 molecules per cell.

	abstract = {Summary
Background
Many cellular processes operate in an “analog” regime in which the magnitude of the response is precisely tailored to the intensity of the stimulus. In order to maintain the coherence of such responses, the cell must provide for proportional expression of multiple target genes across a wide dynamic range of induction states. Our understanding of the strategies used to achieve graded gene regulation is limited.
Results
In this work, we document a relationship between stress-responsive gene expression and the transcription factor Msn2 that is graded over a large range of Msn2 concentrations. We use computational modeling and in vivo and in vitro analyses to dissect the roots of this relationship. Our studies reveal a simple and general strategy based on noncooperative low-affinity interactions between Msn2 and its cognate binding sites as well as competition over a large number of Msn2 binding sites in the genome relative to the number of Msn2 molecules.
Conclusions
In addition to enabling precise tuning of gene expression to the state of the environment, this strategy ensures colinear activation of target genes, allowing for stoichiometric expression of large groups of genes without extensive promoter tuning. Furthermore, such a strategy enables precise modulation of the activity of any given promoter by addition of binding sites without altering the qualitative relationship between different genes in a regulon. This feature renders a given regulon highly “evolvable.”},

Transcriptomic analyses have previously been performed from bulk skin samples or from epithelial and immune cells expanded in cell culture. However, transcriptomic analysis of bulk skin tends to drown out expression signals from relatively rare cells while cell culture methods may significantly alter cellular phenotypes and gene expression profiles. To identify distinct transcriptomic profiles of multiple cell populations without substantially altering cell phenotypes, we employed a fluorescence activated cell sorting method to isolate keratinocytes, dendritic cells, CD4+ T effector cells, and CD8+ T effector cells from healthy skin samples, followed by RNA-seq of each cell population. Principal components analysis revealed distinct clustering of cell types across samples, while differential expression and coexpression network analyses revealed transcriptional profiles of individual cell populations distinct from bulk skin, most strikingly in the least abundant CD8+ T effector population. Our work provides a high resolution view of cutaneous cellular gene expression and suggests that transcriptomic profiling of bulk skin may inadequately capture the contribution of less abundant cell types.},

	abstract = {There is evidence across several species for genetic control of phenotypic variation of complex traits1,2,3,4, such that the variance among phenotypes is genotype dependent. Understanding genetic control of variability is important in evolutionary biology, agricultural selection programmes and human medicine, yet for complex traits, no individual genetic variants associated with variance, as opposed to the mean, have been identified. Here we perform a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of phenotypic variation using ∼170,000 samples on height and body mass index (BMI) in human populations. We report evidence that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7202116 at the FTO gene locus, which is known to be associated with obesity (as measured by mean BMI for each rs7202116 genotype)5,6,7, is also associated with phenotypic variability. We show that the results are not due to scale effects or other artefacts, and find no other experiment-wise significant evidence for effects on variability, either at loci other than FTO for BMI or at any locus for height. The difference in variance for BMI among individuals with opposite homozygous genotypes at the FTO locus is approximately 7\%, corresponding to a difference of ∼0.5 kilograms in the standard deviation of weight. Our results indicate that genetic variants can be discovered that are associated with variability, and that between-person variability in obesity can partly be explained by the genotype at the FTO locus. The results are consistent with reported FTO by environment interactions for BMI8, possibly mediated by DNA methylation9,10. Our BMI results for other SNPs and our height results for all SNPs suggest that most genetic variants, including those that influence mean height or mean BMI, are not associated with phenotypic variance, or that their effects on variability are too small to detect even with samples sizes greater than 100,000.},

To independently evaluate the effects of changes in expression mean and noise we determined the fitness landscapes in mean-noise expression space for 33 genes in yeast. The landscapes can be decomposed into two principal topologies: the fitness effects of protein shortage and surplus. For most genes, the fitness impact of sustained (mean) and short-lived (noise) deviations away from the expression optimum are linked and of similar magnitude. Sensitivity to both protein shortage and surplus creates a fitness landscape in which an epistatic ratchet uncouples the evolution of noise from mean expression, promoting noise minimization. These results demonstrate that noise is detrimental for many genes and reveal non-trivial consequences of mean-noise-fitness topologies for the evolution of gene expression systems.},

Our model exactly predicts the size of experimentally measured Golgi apparatus and vacuole abundance fluctuations, suggesting that cells tolerate the maximum level of variability generated by the Golgi and vacuole biogenesis pathways. We observe large increases in peroxisome abundance fluctuations when cells are transferred from glucose-rich to fatty acid-rich environments. These increased fluctuations are significantly diminished in mutants lacking peroxisome fission factors, leading us to infer that peroxisome biogenesis switches from de novo synthesis to primarily fission. Our work provides a general framework for exploring stochastic organelle biogenesis and using fluctuations to quantitatively unravel the biophysical pathways that control the abundance of subcellular structures.},

We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock3,4,5 to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such ‘rational network design’ may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

An underappreciated point is that MLMA can also increase power in studies without sample structure, by implicitly conditioning on associated loci other than the candidate locus. Numerous variations on the standard MLMA approach have recently been published, with a focus on reducing computational cost. These advances provide researchers applying MLMA methods with many options to choose from, but we caution that MLMA methods are still subject to potential pitfalls.

DNA shape is thought to enable a parsimonious representation of dependencies between nucleotide positions. Here, we propose a unified mathematical representation of the DNA sequence dependence of shape and TF binding, respectively, which simplifies and enhances analysis of shape readout. First, we demonstrate that linear models based on mononucleotide features alone account for 60–70\% of the variance in minor groove width, roll, helix twist, and propeller twist. This explains why simple scoring matrices that ignore all dependencies between nucleotide positions can partially account for DNA shape readout by a TF. Adding dinucleotide features as sequence-to-shape predictors to our model, we can almost perfectly explain the shape parameters. Building on this observation, we developed a post hoc analysis method that can be used to analyze any mechanism-agnostic protein–DNA binding model in terms of shape readout. Our insights provide an alternative strategy for using DNA shape information to enhance our understanding of how cis-regulatory codes are interpreted by the cellular machinery.},

We devised a method for obtaining parallel, highly accurate gene expression measurements from thousands of designed promoters and applied it to measure the effect of systematic changes in the location, number, orientation, affinity and organization of transcription-factor binding sites and nucleosome-disfavoring sequences. Our analyses reveal a clear relationship between expression and binding-site multiplicity, as well as dependencies of expression on the distance between transcription-factor binding sites and gene starts which are transcription-factor specific, including a striking ∼10-bp periodic relationship between gene expression and binding-site location. We show how this approach can measure transcription-factor sequence specificities and the sensitivity of transcription-factor sites to the surrounding sequence context, and compare the activity of 75 yeast transcription factors. Our method can be used to study both cis and trans effects of genotype on transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational control.},

Here we revisit the first synthetic genetic oscillator, the repressilator1, and modify it using principles from stochastic chemistry in single cells. Specifically, we sought to reduce error propagation and information losses, not by adding control loops, but by simply removing existing features. We show that this modification created highly regular and robust oscillations. Furthermore, some streamlined circuits kept 14 generation periods over a range of growth conditions and kept phase for hundreds of generations in single cells, allowing cells in flasks and colonies to oscillate synchronously without any coupling between them. Our results suggest that even the simplest synthetic genetic networks can achieve a precision that rivals natural systems, and emphasize the importance of noise analyses for circuit design in synthetic biology.},

	abstract = {Summary
A central question in biology is whether variability between genetically identical cells exposed to the same culture conditions is largely stochastic or deterministic. Using image-based transcriptomics in millions of single human cells, we find that while variability of cytoplasmic transcript abundance is large, it is for most genes minimally stochastic and can be predicted with multivariate models of the phenotypic state and population context of single cells. Computational multiplexing of these predictive signatures across hundreds of genes revealed a complex regulatory system that controls the observed variability of transcript abundance between individual cells. Mathematical modeling and experimental validation show that nuclear retention and transport of transcripts between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is central to buffering stochastic transcriptional fluctuations in mammalian gene expression. Our work indicates that cellular compartmentalization confines transcriptional noise to the nucleus, thereby preventing it from interfering with the control of single-cell transcript abundance in the cytoplasm.},

Moreover, gene expression noise would seem to impede the evolution of accurate gene regulation, and previous investigations have provided circumstantial evidence that natural selection has acted to lower noise levels. By evolving synthetic Escherichia coli promoters de novo, we here show that, contrary to expectations, promoters exhibit low noise by default. Instead, selection must have acted to increase the noise levels of highly regulated E. coli promoters. We present a general theory of the interplay between gene expression noise and gene regulation that explains these observations. The theory shows that propagation of expression noise from regulators to their targets is not an unwanted side-effect of regulation, but rather acts as a rudimentary form of regulation that facilitates the evolution of more accurate regulation.},

Here we use ancestral protein reconstruction, biochemical experiments, and developmental assays of transgenic animals carrying reconstructed ancestral genes to investigate how the transcription factor Bicoid (Bcd) evolved its central role in anterior-posterior patterning in flies. We show that most of Bcd’s derived functions are attributable to evolutionary changes within its homeodomain (HD) during a phylogenetic interval {\textgreater}140 million years ago. A single substitution from this period (Q50K) accounts almost entirely for the evolution of Bcd’s derived DNA specificity in vitro. In transgenic embryos expressing the reconstructed ancestral HD, however, Q50K confers activation of only a few of Bcd’s transcriptional targets and yields a very partial rescue of anterior development. Adding a second historical substitution (M54R) confers regulation of additional Bcd targets and further rescues anterior development. These results indicate that two epistatically interacting mutations played a major role in the evolution of Bcd’s controlling regulatory role in early development. They also show how ancestral sequence reconstruction can be combined with in vivo characterization of transgenic animals to illuminate the historical mechanisms of developmental evolution.},

The last several years have witnessed an explosion of new technologies, allowing us to apply even more of the modern molecular biology toolkit to single cells. Conceptual progress, however, has been comparatively slow. Here, we provide a framework for classifying both the origins of the differences between individual cells and the consequences of those differences. We discuss how the concept of “random” differences is context dependent, and propose that rigorous definitions of inputs and outputs may bring clarity to the discussion. We also categorize ways in which probabilistic behavior may influence cellular function, highlighting studies that point to exciting future directions in the field.},

Yet, the extent to which individual Nanog-negative cells are differentiated, both from ESCs and from each other, remains unclear. Here, we show the transcriptome of Nanog-negative cells exhibits expression of classes of genes associated with differentiation that are not yet active in cells exposed to differentiation conditions for one day. Long non-coding RNAs, however, exhibit more changes in expression in the one-day-differentiated cells than in Nanog-negative cells. These results are consistent with the concept that Nanog-negative cells may contain subpopulations of both lineage-primed and differentiated cells. Single cell analysis showed that Nanog-negative cells display substantial and coherent heterogeneity in lineage marker expression in progressively nested subsets of cells exhibiting low levels of Nanog, then low levels of Oct4, and then a set of lineage markers, which express intensely in a small subset of these more differentiated cells. Our results suggest that the observed enrichment of lineage-specific marker gene expression in Nanog-negative cells is associated with spontaneous differentiation of a subset of these cells rather than the more random expression that may be associated with reversible lineage priming.},

However, the intermediate stages through which individual cells progress during reprogramming are largely undefined. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing4,5,6,7 at multiple time points to dissect direct reprogramming from mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced neuronal cells. By deconstructing heterogeneity at each time point and ordering cells by transcriptome similarity, we find that the molecular reprogramming path is remarkably continuous. Overexpression of the proneural pioneer factor Ascl1 results in a well-defined initialization, causing cells to exit the cell cycle and re-focus gene expression through distinct neural transcription factors. The initial transcriptional response is relatively homogeneous among fibroblasts, suggesting that the early steps are not limiting for productive reprogramming. Instead, the later emergence of a competing myogenic program and variable transgene dynamics over time appear to be the major efficiency limits of direct reprogramming. Moreover, a transcriptional state, distinct from donor and target cell programs, is transiently induced in cells undergoing productive reprogramming. Our data provide a high-resolution approach for understanding transcriptome states during lineage differentiation.},

	abstract = {Summary
During cellular reprogramming, only a small fraction of cells become induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Previous analyses of gene expression during reprogramming were based on populations of cells, impeding single-cell level identification of reprogramming events. We utilized two gene expression technologies to profile 48 genes in single cells at various stages during the reprogramming process. Analysis of early stages revealed considerable variation in gene expression between cells in contrast to late stages. Expression of Esrrb, Utf1, Lin28, and Dppa2 is a better predictor for cells to progress into iPSCs than expression of the previously suggested reprogramming markers Fbxo15, Fgf4, and Oct4. Stochastic gene expression early in reprogramming is followed by a late hierarchical phase with Sox2 being the upstream factor in a gene expression hierarchy. Finally, downstream factors derived from the late phase, which do not include Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, and Nanog, can activate the pluripotency circuitry.},

We developed a proteome-wide fractionation-mass-spectrometry strategy called differential fractionation (DIF-FRAC) to discover RNP complexes by their sensitivity to RNase A treatment. Applying this to human cells reveals a set of 115 highly-stable endogenous RNPs, and a further 1,428 protein complexes whose subunits associate with RNA, thus indicating over 20\% of all complexes are RNPs. We show RNP complexes either dissociate, change composition, or form stable protein-only complexes upon RNase A treatment, uncovering the biochemical role of RNA in complex formation. We combine these data into a resource, rna.MAP (rna.proteincomplexes.org), which demonstrates that well-studied complexes such as replication factor C (RFC) and centralspindlin exist as RNP complexes, providing new insight into their cellular functions. We apply our method to red blood cells and mouse embryonic stem cells to demonstrate its ability to identify cell-type specific roles for RNP complexes in diverse systems. Thus the methodology has the potential uncover RNP complexes in different human tissues, disease states and throughout all domains of life.},

	abstract = {Macrophages play a critical role in the elimination of fungal pathogens. They are sensed via cell surface pattern-recognition receptors and are phagocytosed into newly formed organelles called phagosomes. Phagosomes mature through the recruitment of proteins and lysosomes, resulting in addition of proteolytic enzymes and acidification of the microenvironment. Our earlier studies demonstrated an essential role of Dectin-1-dependent activation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) in the maturation of fungal containing phagosomes. The absence of Syk activity interrupted phago-lysosomal fusion resulting in arrest at an early phagosome stage. In this study, we sought to define the contribution of Syk to the control of phagocytosed live Candida glabrata in primary macrophages. To accurately measure intracellular yeast division, we designed a carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) yeast division assay in which bright fluorescent parent cells give rise to dim daughter cells. The CFSE-labeling of C. glabrata did not affect the growth rate of the yeast. Following incubation with macrophages, internalized CFSE-labeled C. glabrata were retrieved by cellular lysis, tagged using ConA-647, and the amount of residual CFSE fluorescence was assessed by flow cytometry. C. glabrata remained undivided (CFSE bright) for up to 18 h in co-culture with primary macrophages. Treatment of macrophages with R406, a specific Syk inhibitor, resulted in loss of intracellular control of C. glabrata with initiation of division within 4 h. Delayed Syk inhibition after 8 h was less effective indicating that Syk is critically required at early stages of macrophage–fungal interaction. In conclusion, we demonstrate a new method of tracking division of C. glabrata using CFSE labeling. Our results suggest that early Syk activation is essential for macrophage control of phagocytosed C. glabrata.},

	abstract = {Transcriptional responses to extracellular stimuli involve tuning the rates of transcript production and degradation. Here, we show that the time‐dependent profiles of these rates can be inferred from simultaneous measurements of precursor mRNA (pre‐mRNA) and mature mRNA profiles. Transcriptome‐wide measurements demonstrate that genes with similar mRNA profiles often exhibit marked differences in the amplitude and onset of their production rate. The latter is characterized by a large dynamic range, with a group of genes exhibiting an unexpectedly strong transient production overshoot, thereby accelerating their induction and, when combined with time‐dependent degradation, shaping transient responses with precise timing and amplitude.
Synopsis
Genome‐wide simultaneous measurements of pre‐mRNA and mRNA expression reveal unexpected time‐dependent transcript production and degradation profiles in response to external stimulus, as well as a striking lack of concordance between mRNA abundance and transcript production profiles.

By analyzing the signals from intronic probes of exon arrays, we performed, for the first time, genome‐wide measurement of pre‐mRNA expression dynamics.We discovered a striking lack of correspondence between mRNA and pre‐mRNA temporal expression profiles following stimulus, demonstrating that measurement of mRNA dynamics does not suffice to infer transcript production profiles.By combining simultaneous measurement of pre‐mRNA and mRNA profiles with a simple new quantitative theoretical description of transcription, we are able to infer complex time dependence of both transcript production and mRNA degradation.The production profiles of many transcripts reveal an operational strategy we termed Production Overshoot, which is used to accelerate mRNA response. The biological relevance of our findings was substantiated by observing similar results when studying the response of three different mammalian cell types to different stimuli.},

	abstract = {Cell fate choice and commitment of multipotent progenitor cells to a differentiated lineage requires broad changes of their gene expression profile. But how progenitor cells overcome the stability of their gene expression configuration (attractor) to exit the attractor in one direction remains elusive. Here we show that commitment of blood progenitor cells to the erythroid or myeloid lineage is preceded by the destabilization of their high-dimensional attractor state, such that differentiating cells undergo a critical state transition. Single-cell resolution analysis of gene expression in populations of differentiating cells affords a new quantitative index for predicting critical transitions in a high-dimensional state space based on decrease of correlation between cells and concomitant increase of correlation between genes as cells approach a tipping point. The detection of “rebellious cells” that enter the fate opposite to the one intended corroborates the model of preceding destabilization of a progenitor attractor. Thus, early warning signals associated with critical transitions can be detected in statistical ensembles of high-dimensional systems, offering a formal theory-based approach for analyzing single-cell molecular profiles that goes beyond current computational pattern recognition, does not require knowledge of specific pathways, and could be used to predict impending major shifts in development and disease.},

	abstract = {In some recent studies, a view emerged that stochastic dynamics governing the switching of cells from one differentiation state to another could be characterized by a peak in gene expression variability at the point of fate commitment. We have tested this hypothesis at the single-cell level by analyzing primary chicken erythroid progenitors through their differentiation process and measuring the expression of selected genes at six sequential time-points after induction of differentiation. In contrast to population-based expression data, single-cell gene expression data revealed a high cell-to-cell variability, which was masked by averaging. We were able to show that the correlation network was a very dynamical entity and that a subgroup of genes tend to follow the predictions from the dynamical network biomarker (DNB) theory. In addition, we also identified a small group of functionally related genes encoding proteins involved in sterol synthesis that could act as the initial drivers of the differentiation. In order to assess quantitatively the cell-to-cell variability in gene expression and its evolution in time, we used Shannon entropy as a measure of the heterogeneity. Entropy values showed a significant increase in the first 8 h of the differentiation process, reaching a peak between 8 and 24 h, before decreasing to significantly lower values. Moreover, we observed that the previous point of maximum entropy precedes two paramount key points: an irreversible commitment to differentiation between 24 and 48 h followed by a significant increase in cell size variability at 48 h. In conclusion, when analyzed at the single cell level, the differentiation process looks very different from its classical population average view. New observables (like entropy) can be computed, the behavior of which is fully compatible with the idea that differentiation is not a “simple” program that all cells execute identically but results from the dynamical behavior of the underlying molecular network.},

Functional screens based on reporter assays have previously been of insufficient throughput to test the vast space of SNPs for possible effects on enhancer and promoter activity. Here, we have leveraged the throughput of the SuRE reporter technology to survey a total of 5.9 million SNPs, including 57\% of the known common SNPs. We identified more than 30 thousand SNPs that alter the activity of putative regulatory elements, often in a cell-type specific manner.

We apply EISA to 17 diverse data sets to show that most intronic reads arise from nuclear RNA and changes in intronic read counts accurately predict changes in transcriptional activity. Furthermore, changes in post-transcriptional regulation can be predicted from differences between exonic and intronic changes. EISA reveals both transcriptional and post-transcriptional contributions to expression changes, increasing the amount of information that can be gained from RNA-seq data sets.},

Here we report the development of SnapShot-Seq, a set of computational methods that allow the determination of in vivo rates of pre-mRNA synthesis, splicing, intron degradation, and mRNA decay from a single RNA-Seq snapshot of total cellular RNA. SnapShot-Seq can detect in vivo changes in the rates of specific steps of splicing, and it provides genome-wide estimates of pre-mRNA synthesis rates comparable to those obtained via labeling of newly synthesized RNA. We used SnapShot-Seq to investigate the origins of the intrinsic bimodality of metazoan gene expression levels, and our results suggest that this bimodality is partly due to spillover of transcriptional activation from highly expressed genes to their poorly expressed neighbors. SnapShot-Seq dramatically expands the information obtainable from a standard RNA-Seq experiment.},

	abstract = {Cells switch between various stable genetic programs (attractors) to accommodate environmental conditions. Signal transduction machineries efficiently convey environmental changes to the gene regulation apparatus in order to express the appropriate genetic program. However, since the number of environmental conditions is much larger than that of available genetic programs so that the cell may utilize the same genetic program for a large set of conditions, it may not have evolved a signaling pathway for every environmental condition, notably those that are rarely encountered. Here we show that in the absence of signal transduction, switching to the appropriate attractor state expressing the genes that afford adaptation to the external condition can occur. In a synthetic bistable gene switch in Escherichia coli in which mutually inhibitory operons govern the expression of two genes required in two alternative nutritional environments, cells reliably selected the “adaptive attractor” driven by gene expression noise. A mathematical model suggests that the “non-adaptive attractor” is avoided because in unfavorable conditions, cellular activity is lower, which suppresses mRNA metabolism, leading to larger fluctuations in gene expression. This, in turn, renders the non-adaptive state less stable. Although attractor selection is not as efficient as signal transduction via a dedicated cascade, it is simple and robust, and may represent a primordial mechanism for adaptive responses that preceded the evolution of signaling cascades for the frequently encountered environmental changes.},

But how ratios of lineage-determining transcription factors stabilize progenitor cells and resolve their indeterminacy to commit them to discrete, mutually exclusive fates remains unexplained. We used a simple model and experimental measurements to analyze the dynamics of a binary fate decision governed by a gene-circuit containing auto-stimulation and cross-inhibition, as embodied by the GATA1–PU.1 paradigm. This circuit generates stable attractors corresponding to erythroid and myelomonocytic fates, as well as an uncommitted metastable state characterized by coexpression of both regulators, explaining the phenomenon of “multilineage priming”. GATA1 and PU.1 mRNA and transcriptome dynamics of differentiating progenitor cells confirm that commitment occurs in two stages, as suggested by the model: first, the progenitor state is destabilized in an almost symmetrical bifurcation event, resulting in a poised state at the boundary between the two lineage-specific attractors; second, the cell is driven to the respective, now accessible attractors. This minimal model captures fundamental features of binary cell fate decisions, uniting the concepts of stochastic (selective) and deterministic (instructive) regulation, and hence, may apply to a wider range of binary fate decision points.},

Cancer cells within individual tumors often exist in distinct phenotypic states that differ in functional attributes. While cancer cell populations typically display distinctive equilibria in the proportion of cells in various states, the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here, we study the dynamics of phenotypic proportions in human breast cancer cell lines. We show that subpopulations of cells purified for a given phenotypic state return towards equilibrium proportions over time. These observations can be explained by a Markov model in which cells transition stochastically between states. A prediction of this model is that, given certain conditions, any subpopulation of cells will return to equilibrium phenotypic proportions over time. A second prediction is that breast cancer stem-like cells arise de novo from non-stem-like cells. These findings contribute to our understanding of cancer heterogeneity and reveal how stochasticity in single-cell behaviors promotes phenotypic equilibrium in populations of cancer cells.},

	abstract = {A number of important pluripotency regulators, including the transcription factor Nanog, are observed to fluctuate stochastically in individual embryonic stem cells. By transiently priming cells for commitment to different lineages, these fluctuations are thought to be important to the maintenance of, and exit from, pluripotency. However, because temporal changes in intracellular protein abundances cannot be measured directly in live cells, fluctuations are typically assessed using genetically engineered reporter cell lines that produce a fluorescent signal as a proxy for protein expression. Here, using a combination of mathematical modeling and experiment, we show that there are unforeseen ways in which widely used reporter strategies can systematically disturb the dynamics they are intended to monitor, sometimes giving profoundly misleading results. In the case of Nanog, we show how genetic reporters can compromise the behavior of important pluripotency-sustaining positive feedback loops, and induce a bifurcation in the underlying dynamics that gives rise to heterogeneous Nanog expression patterns in reporter cell lines that are not representative of the wild-type. These findings help explain the range of published observations of Nanog variability and highlight the problem of measurement in live cells.},

Heterogeneous expression of the transcription factor NANOG has been linked to the existence of various functional states in pluripotent stem cells. This heterogeneity seems to arise from fluctuations of Nanog expression in individual cells, but a thorough characterization of these fluctuations and their impact on the pluripotent state is still lacking. Here, we have used a novel fluorescent reporter to investigate the temporal dynamics of NANOG expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), and to dissect the lineage potential of mESCs at different NANOG states. Our results show that stochastic NANOG fluctuations are widespread in mESCs, with essentially all expressing cells showing fluctuations in NANOG levels, even when cultured in ground-state conditions (2i media). We further show that fluctuations have similar kinetics when mESCs are cultured in standard conditions (serum plus leukemia inhibitory factor) or ground-state conditions, implying that NANOG fluctuations are inherent to the pluripotent state. We have then compared the developmental potential of low-NANOG and high-NANOG mESCs, grown in different conditions, and confirm that mESCs are more susceptible to enter differentiation at the low-NANOG state. Further analysis by gene expression profiling reveals that low-NANOG cells have marked expression of lineage-affiliated genes, with variable profiles according to the signalling environment. By contrast, high-NANOG cells show a more stable expression profile in different environments, with minimal expression of lineage markers. Altogether, our data support a model in which stochastic NANOG fluctuations provide opportunities for mESCs to explore multiple lineage options, modulating their probability to change functional state.},

	abstract = {Background The pluripotent state in embryonic stem (ES) cells is controlled by a core network of transcription factors that includes Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2. Nanog is required to reach pluripotency during somatic reprogramming and is the only core factor whose overexpression is able to oppose differentiation-promoting signals. Additionally, Nanog expression is known to fluctuate in ES cells, and different levels of Nanog seem to correlate with ES cells’ ability to respond to differentiation promoting signals. Elucidating how dynamic Nanog levels are regulated in pluripotent cells and modulate their potential is therefore critical to develop a better understanding of the pluripotent state. Methodology/Principal Findings We describe the generation and validation of a mouse ES cell line with a novel Nanog reporter (Nd, from Nanog dynamics), containing a BAC transgene where the short-lived fluorescent protein VNP is placed under Nanog regulation. We show that Nanog and VNP have similar half-lives, and that Nd cells provide an accurate and measurable read-out for the dynamic levels of Nanog. Using this reporter, we could show that ES cells with low Nanog levels indeed have higher degree of priming to differentiation, when compared with high-Nanog cells. However, low-Nanog ES cells maintain high levels of Oct4 and Sox2 and can revert to a state of high-Nanog expression, indicating that they are still within the window of pluripotency. We further show that the observed changes in Nanog levels correlate with ES cell morphology and that Nanog dynamic expression is modulated by the cellular environment. Conclusions/Significance The novel reporter ES cell line here described allows an accurate monitoring of Nanog’s dynamic expression in the pluripotent state. This reporter will thus be a valuable tool to obtain quantitative measurements of global gene expression in pluripotent ES cells in different states, allowing a detailed molecular mapping of the pluripotency landscape.},

Using single-cell gene expression analyses combined with different reporters for the two alleles of Nanog, we show that Nanog is biallelelically expressed in ES cells independently of culture condition. We also show that the overall variation in endogenous Nanog expression in ES cells is very similar to that of several other pluripotency markers.

Transcriptional regulation in metazoans occurs through long-range genomic contacts between enhancers and promoters, and most genes are transcribed in episodic “bursts” of RNA synthesis. To understand the relationship between these two phenomena and the dynamic regulation of genes in response to upstream signals, we describe the use of live-cell RNA imaging coupled with Hi-C measurements and dissect the endogenous regulation of the estrogen-responsive TFF1 gene. Although TFF1 is highly induced, we observe short active periods and variable inactive periods ranging from minutes to days. The heterogeneity in inactive times gives rise to the widely observed “noise” in human gene expression and explains the distribution of protein levels in human tissue. We derive a mathematical model of regulation that relates transcription, chromosome structure, and the cell’s ability to sense changes in estrogen and predicts that hypervariability is largely dynamic and does not reflect a stable biological state.},

Single-cell genomics and proteomics enable not only precise characterization of cell state, but also provide a stunningly high-resolution view of transitions between states. These measurements may finally make explicit the metaphor that C.H. Waddington posed nearly 60 years ago to explain cellular plasticity: Cells are residents of a vast “landscape” of possible states, over which they travel during development and in disease. Single-cell technology helps not only locate cells on this landscape, but illuminates the molecular mechanisms that shape the landscape itself.

Here, we characterize for the first time, to our knowledge, the detailed dynamics of a cancer cell attractor at single-cell resolution. The results provide quantitative knowledge on nongenetic intercellular heterogeneity and its dynamics within an isogenic cell population of cancerous cells, affording insights at a previously unidentified level of resolution between molecular pathways and macroscopic tumor behaviors. This new dimension of characterizing tumor cells might impact design of future rational cancer therapies by taking into account the dynamic robustness and high volatility of a heterogeneous cancer cell population., The observed intercellular heterogeneity within a clonal cell population can be mapped as dynamical states clustered around an attractor point in gene expression space, owing to a balance between homeostatic forces and stochastic fluctuations. These dynamics have led to the cancer cell attractor conceptual model, with implications for both carcinogenesis and new therapeutic concepts. Immortalized and malignant EBV-carrying B-cell lines were used to explore this model and characterize the detailed structure of cell attractors. Any subpopulation selected from a population of cells repopulated the whole original basin of attraction within days to weeks. Cells at the basin edges were unstable and prone to apoptosis. Cells continuously changed states within their own attractor, thus driving the repopulation, as shown by fluorescent dye tracing. Perturbations of key regulatory genes induced a jump to a nearby attractor. Using the Fokker–Planck equation, this cell population behavior could be described as two virtual, opposing influences on the cells: one attracting toward the center and the other promoting diffusion in state space (noise). Transcriptome analysis suggests that these forces result from high-dimensional dynamics of the gene regulatory network. We propose that they can be generalized to all cancer cell populations and represent intrinsic behaviors of tumors, offering a previously unidentified characteristic for studying cancer.},

Both fronts of advance have exposed a rich heterogeneity of cell states within uniform cell populations in many biological contexts, producing a new kind of data that has stimulated a series of computational analysis methods for data visualization, dimensionality reduction, and “cluster” (subpopulation) identification. The next step is to go beyond collecting data and correlating data points with computational analyses: to connect the dots, that is, to understand what actually underlies the identified data patterns. This entails interpreting the “clouds of points”, each representing a cell in state space, and their structure as manifestation of the regulation by the molecular network. This control of cell state dynamics can be formalized as a quasi-potential landscape, as first proposed by Waddington.

	abstract = {Precision Oncology seeks to identify and target the mutation that drives a tumor. Despite its straightforward rationale, concerns about its effectiveness are mounting. What is the biological explanation for the "imprecision?" First, Precision Oncology relies on indiscriminate sequencing of genomes in biopsies that barely represent the heterogeneous mix of tumor cells. Second, findings that defy the orthodoxy of oncogenic "driver mutations" are now accumulating: the ubiquitous presence of oncogenic mutations in silent premalignancies or the dynamic switching without mutations between various cell phenotypes that promote progression. Most troublesome is the observation that cancer cells that survive treatment still will have suffered cytotoxic stress and thereby enter a stem cell–like state, the seeds for recurrence. The benefit of “precision targeting” of mutations is inherently limited by this counterproductive effect. These findings confirm that there is no precise linear causal relationship between tumor genotype and phenotype, a reminder of logician Carveth Read's caution that being vaguely right may be preferable to being precisely wrong. An open-minded embrace of the latest inconvenient findings indicating nongenetic and "imprecise" phenotype dynamics of tumors as summarized in this review will be paramount if Precision Oncology is ultimately to lead to clinical benefits.

We describe a new method, ergodic rate analysis (ERA), that uses single cell measurements of fixed steady-state populations to accurately infer the rates of molecular events, including rates of cell growth. ERA exploits the fact that the number of cells in a particular state is related to the average transit time through that state. With this method, one can calculate full time trajectories of any feature that can be labeled fixed cells, for example levels of phospho-proteins or total cellular mass. Using ERA we find evidence for a size-discriminatory process at the G1/S transition that acts to decrease cell-to-cell size variation.},

Using stochastic reaction kinetic theory, we discuss cooperative transitions in cellular biochemical processes at both the macromolecular and the cellular levels. We show that fluctuation-enhanced sensitivity (stochastic focusing) shares an essential feature with the transition in a bistable system. The same theory explains zeroth-order ultrasensitivity with temporal cooperativity. Dynamic cooperativity in fluctuating enzyme (i.e., dynamic disorder), stochastic focusing, and the recently proposed stochastic binary decision all have a shared mechanism: They are generalizations of the hyperbolic response of Michaelis-Menten kinetics x/(K+x), with fluctuating K or stochastic x. Sigmoidal dependence on substrate concentration necessarily yields affinity amplification for competing ligands; both sigmoidal response and affinity amplification exhibit a square law. We suggest two important characteristics in a noise: its multimodal distribution structure and its temporal irreversibility. The former gives rise to self-organized complexity, and the latter contains useful, albeit hidden, free energy that can be utilized for biological functions.

However, dynamic non-genetic heterogeneity of clonal cell populations continuously produces metastable phenotypic variants (persisters), some of which represent stem-like states that confer resistance. Even without genetic mutations, Darwinian selection can expand these resistant variants, which would explain the invariably rapid emergence of stem-like resistant cells. Here, by using quantitative measurements and modelling, we show that appearance of multidrug resistance in HL60 leukemic cells following treatment with vincristine is not explained by Darwinian selection but by Lamarckian induction. Single-cell longitudinal monitoring confirms the induction of multidrug resistance in individual cells. Associated transcriptome changes indicate a lasting stress response consistent with a drug-induced switch between high-dimensional cancer attractors. Resistance induction correlates with Wnt pathway upregulation and is suppressed by β-catenin knockdown, revealing a new opportunity for early therapeutic intervention against the development of drug resistance.},

Minimal sets of transcription factors can directly reprogram somatic cells into neurons. However, epigenetic remodeling during neuronal reprogramming has not been well reconciled with transcriptional regulation. Here we show that NeuroD1 achieves direct neuronal conversion from mouse microglia both in vitro and in vivo. Exogenous NeuroD1 initially occupies closed chromatin regions associated with bivalent trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and H3K27me3 marks in microglia to induce neuronal gene expression. These regions are resolved to a monovalent H3K4me3 mark at later stages of reprogramming to establish the neuronal identity. Furthermore, the transcriptional repressors Scrt1 and Meis2 are induced as NeuroD1 target genes, resulting in a decrease in the expression of microglial genes. In parallel, the microglial epigenetic signature in promoter and enhancer regions is erased. These findings reveal NeuroD1 pioneering activity accompanied by global epigenetic remodeling for two sequential events: onset of neuronal property acquisition and loss of the microglial identity during reprogramming.},

We present and validate a computational approach that uses latent variable models to account for such hidden factors. We show that our single-cell latent variable model (scLVM) allows the identification of otherwise undetectable subpopulations of cells that correspond to different stages during the differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 2 cells. Our approach can be used not only to identify cellular subpopulations but also to tease apart different sources of gene expression heterogeneity in single-cell transcriptomes.},

The study of cell fate transitions can reveal much about the transcriptional regulatory programs that underlie these phenotypic changes and give rise to the coordinated patterns in expression changes that we observe. The application of gene expression state space trajectories to capture cell fate transitions at the genome-wide level is one approach currently used in the literature. In this paper, we analyze the gene expression dataset of Huang et al. (2005) which follows the differentiation of promyelocytes into neutrophil-like cells in the presence of inducers dimethyl sulfoxide and all-trans retinoic acid. Huang et al. (2005) build on the work of Kauffman (2004) who raised the attractor hypothesis, stating that cells exist in an expression landscape and their expression trajectories converge towards attractive sites in this landscape. We propose an alternative interpretation that explains this convergent behavior by recognizing that there are two types of processes participating in these cell fate transitions—core processes that include the specific differentiation pathways of promyelocytes to neutrophils, and transient processes that capture those pathways and responses specific to the inducer. Using functional enrichment analyses, specific biological examples and an analysis of the trajectories and their core and transient components we provide a validation of our hypothesis using the Huang et al. (2005) dataset.},

The associated changes in gene expression patterns exhibit time-directionality. This “arrow of time” in the collective change of gene expression across multiple stable gene expression patterns (attractors) is not explained by the regulated activation, the suppression of individual genes which are bidirectional molecular processes, or by the standard dynamical models of the underlying gene circuit which only account for local stability of attractors. To capture the global dynamics of this nonequilibrium system and gain insight in the time-asymmetry of state transitions, we computed the quasipotential landscape of the stochastic dynamics of a canonical gene circuit that governs branching cell fate commitment. The potential landscape reveals the global dynamics and permits the calculation of potential barriers between cell phenotypes imposed by the circuit architecture. The generic asymmetry of barrier heights indicates that the transition from the uncommitted multipotent state to differentiated states is inherently unidirectional. The model agrees with observations and predicts the extreme conditions for reprogramming cells back to the undifferentiated state.},

Additional investigations will help to further refine modeling strategies, rendering them applicable toward the study of the development and stability of cancer cells or even other reprogramming processes such as lineage conversion.

Such culture of proximate explanation that uses qualitative arguments, simple arrow–arrow schemes or metaphors persists despite the ceaseless accumulation of ‘omics’ data and the rise of systems biology that now offers precise conceptual tools to explain emergent cell behaviours from gene networks. To facilitate the embrace of the principles of physics and mathematics that underlie such systems and help to bridge the gap between the formal description of theorists and the intuition of experimental biologists, we discuss in qualitative terms three perspectives outside the realm of their familiar linear-deterministic view: (i) state space (ii), high-dimensionality and (iii) heterogeneity. These concepts jointly offer a new vista on stem cell regulation that naturally explains many novel, counterintuitive observations and their inherent inevitability, obviating the need for ad hoc explanations of their existence based on natural selection.

By exposing cells to pulses of Brn2, we find that the pluripotency network rejects Brn2 inputs that are below specific magnitude or duration thresholds, but allows rapid differentiation when both thresholds are satisfied. The filtering properties of the network arise through its positive feedback architecture and the intrinsic half-life of Nanog, which determines the duration threshold in the network.

	abstract = {Background
To understand the heterogeneous behaviors of individual cancer cells, it is essential to investigate gene expression levels as well as their divergence between different individual cells. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing-related technologies have enabled us to conduct a single-cell RNA-Seq analysis of a series of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines.

Results
We analyze a total of 336 single-cell RNA-Seq libraries from seven cell lines. The results are highly robust regarding both average expression levels and the relative gene expression differences between individual cells. Gene expression diversity is characteristic depending on genes and pathways. Analyses of individual cells treated with the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor vandetanib reveal that, while the ribosomal genes and many other so-called house-keeping genes reduce their relative expression diversity during the drug treatment, the genes that are directly targeted by vandetanib, the EGFR and RET genes, remain constant. Rigid transcriptional control of these genes may not allow plastic changes of their expression with the drug treatment or during the cellular acquisition of drug resistance. Additionally, we find that the gene expression patterns of cancer-related genes are sometimes more diverse than expected based on the founder cells. Furthermore, we find that this diversity is occasionally latent in a normal state and initially becomes apparent after the drug treatment.

Conclusions
Characteristic patterns in gene expression divergence, which would not be revealed by transcriptome analysis of bulk cells, may also play important roles when cells acquire drug resistance, perhaps by providing a cellular reservoir for gene expression programs.

Single-cell gene expression reveals the diversity within a differentiated cell type. Often, cells of the same type show a continuum of gene-expression patterns. The origin of such continuum gene-expression patterns is unclear. To address this, we develop a theory to understand how a continuum provides division of labor in a tissue in which cells collectively contribute to several tasks. We find that a continuum is optimal when there are spatial gradients in the tissue that affect the performance in each task. The continuum is bounded inside a polyhedron whose vertices are expression profiles optimal at each task. We test this using single-cell gene expression for intestinal villi and liver hepatocytes, which form a curved 1D trajectory and a full 3D tetrahedron in gene-expression space, respectively. We infer the tasks for both cell types and characterize the spatial zonation of the task-specialist cells. This approach can be generally applied to other tissues.},

Underlying this complexity is a differential expression of genes, leading to a motley of phenotypes which orchestrate the hallmarks of cancer. The idea of treating, suppressing or even preventing all forms of cancer with a single form of therapy seems untenable given the complexities of these gene expression profiles. However, recent advances in the study of immediate early genes, a family of genes that are rapidly and transiently upregulated following an external stimulus such as growth factors, hormones or stress, and their ubiquitous involvement in regulating oncogenomic responses may lend itself to new and unique therapies. At the very least, understanding and targeting immediate early gene expression and function remains an untapped area in cancer prevention research, and could very well provide new resources in cancer treatment and new perspectives in directed cancer suppression. In this review, we will discuss the critical role immediate early genes play in cancer progression, and provide specific examples of immediate early gene function and inhibition.},

	volume = {58},
	issn = {0079-6603},
	abstract = {Complex cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis are regulated in part by extracellular signaling molecules: for example, polypeptide growth factors, cytokines, and peptide hormones. Many polypeptide growth factors exert their mitogenic effects by binding to specific cell surface receptor protein tyrosine kinases. This interaction triggers numerous biochemical responses, including changes in phospholipid metabolism, the activation of a protein phosphorylation cascade, and the enhanced expression of specific immediate-early, delayed-early, or late response genes. In this review, I summarize the major findings obtained from studies investigating the effects of serum or individual polypeptide growth factors on gene expression in murine fibroblasts. Several experimental approaches, including differential hybridization screening of cDNA libraries and differential display, have been employed to identify mRNA species that are expressed at elevated levels in serum- or polypeptide growth factor-stimulated cells. These studies have demonstrated that serum- and growth factor-inducible genes encode a diverse family of proteins, including DNA-binding transcription factors, cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix proteins, metabolic enzymes, secreted chemokines, and serine-threonine kinases. Some of these gene products act as effectors of specific cell cycle functions (e.g., enzymes involved in nucleotide and DNA synthesis), others are required to successfully convert a metabolically inactive cell to a metabolically active cell that will eventually increase in size and then divide (e.g., glucose-metabolizing enzymes), and some actually function as positive or negative regulators of cell cycle progression. In conclusion, research conducted during the past 15 years on serum- and growth factor-regulated gene expression in murine fibroblasts has provided significant insight into mitogenic signal transduction and cell growth control.},

These spontaneous expression differences underlie cell fate diversity in both differentiation and disease [2]. The mechanisms responsible for generating expression variability are poorly understood. Using singlecell transcriptomics, we show that transcript variability emerging during Dictyostelium differentiation is driven predominantly by repression rather than activation. The increased variability of repressed genes was observed over a broad range of expression levels, indicating that variability is actively imposed and not a passive statistical effect of the reduced numbers of molecules accompanying repression. These ﬁndings can be explained by a simple model of transcript production, with expression controlled by the frequency, rather than the magnitude, of transcriptional ﬁring events. Our study reveals that the generation of differences between cells can be a direct consequence of the basic mechanisms of transcriptional regulation.},

Single‐cell Hierarchical Poisson Factorization (scHPF) is a Bayesian factorization method for de novo discovery of both continuously varying and subpopulation‐specific expression patterns in single‐cell RNA‐sequencing data.

scHPF takes genome‐wide molecular counts as input, avoids prior normalization, captures the statistical structure of scRNA‐seq data better than alternative methods, and has fast, memory‐efficient inference on sparse scRNA‐seq data.Applied to scRNA‐seq of a spatially sampled high‐grade glioma, scHPF reveals regional differences in lineage resemblance within glioma subpopulations.One regionally biased gene signature enriched in astrocyte‐like glioma cells is associated with poor survival in glioblastoma.},

We find that transcriptional programs can be reproducibly identified at 1\% of conventional read depths. We demonstrate that this resilience to noise of "shallow" sequencing derives from a natural property, low dimensionality, which is a fundamental feature of gene expression data. Accordingly, our conclusions hold for ∼350 single-cell and bulk gene expression datasets across yeast, mouse, and human. In total, our approach provides quantitative guidelines for the choice of sequencing depth necessary to achieve a desired level of analytical resolution. We codify these guidelines in an open-source read depth calculator.

	abstract = {Individual cells in genetically homogeneous populations have been found to express different numbers of molecules of specific proteins. We investigated the origins of these variations in mammalian cells by counting individual molecules of mRNA produced from a reporter gene that was stably integrated into the cell's genome. We found that there are massive variations in the number of mRNA molecules present in each cell. These variations occur because mRNAs are synthesized in short but intense bursts of transcription beginning when the gene transitions from an inactive to an active state and ending when they transition back to the inactive state. We show that these transitions are intrinsically random and not due to global, extrinsic factors such as the levels of transcriptional activators. Moreover, the gene activation causes burst-like expression of all genes within a wider genomic locus. We further found that bursts are also exhibited in the synthesis of natural genes. The bursts of mRNA expression can be buffered at the protein level by slow protein degradation rates. A stochastic model of gene activation and inactivation was developed to explain the statistical properties of the bursts. The model showed that increasing the level of transcription factors increases the average size of the bursts rather than their frequency. These results demonstrate that gene expression in mammalian cells is subject to large, intrinsically random fluctuations and raise questions about how cells are able to function in the face of such noise.},

High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing techniques are able to simultaneously quantify expression levels of several thousands of genes within individual cells for tens of thousands of cells within a complex tissue. This has led to development of novel computational methods to analyze this high-dimensional data, investigating longstanding and fundamental questions regarding the granularity of cell types, the deﬁnition of cell states, and transitions from one cell type to another along developmental trajectories. In this perspective, we outline this emerging ﬁeld starting from the ‘‘input data’’ (e.g., quantifying transcription levels in single cells), which are analyzed to deﬁne ‘‘identities’’ (e.g., cell types, states, and key genes) and to build ‘‘interactions’’ using models that can infer relations and transitions between cells.},

By contrast, driving differentiation by ectopically expressing terminal transcription factors (direct programming) can generate similar fates by alternative routes. How differentiation in direct programming relates to embryonic differentiation is unclear. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing to compare two motor neuron differentiation protocols: a standard protocol approximating the embryonic lineage, and a direct programming method. Both initially undergo similar early neural commitment. Later, the direct programming path diverges into a novel transitional state rather than following the expected embryonic spinal intermediates. The novel state in direct programming has specific and uncharacteristic gene expression. It forms a loop in gene expression space that converges separately onto the same final motor neuron state as the standard path. Despite their different developmental histories, motor neurons from both protocols structurally, functionally, and transcriptionally resemble motor neurons isolated from embryos.},

Embryonic stem cell (ESC) culture conditions are important for maintaining long-term self-renewal, and they influence cellular pluripotency state. Here, we report single cell RNA-sequencing of mESCs cultured in three different conditions: serum, 2i, and the alternative ground state a2i. We find that the cellular transcriptomes of cells grown in these conditions are distinct, with 2i being the most similar to blastocyst cells and including a subpopulation resembling the two-cell embryo state. Overall levels of intercellular gene expression heterogeneity are comparable across the three conditions. However, this masks variable expression of pluripotency genes in serum cells and homogeneous expression in 2i and a2i cells. Additionally, genes related to the cell cycle are more variably expressed in the 2i and a2i conditions. Mining of our dataset for correlations in gene expression allowed us to identify additional components of the pluripotency network, including Ptma and Zfp640, illustrating its value as a resource for future discovery.},

Here we set out to characterize transcriptional heterogeneity in mouse PSCs by single-cell expression profiling under different chemical and genetic perturbations. Signalling factors and developmental regulators show highly variable expression, with expression states for some variable genes heritable through multiple cell divisions. Expression variability and population heterogeneity can be influenced by perturbation of signalling pathways and chromatin regulators. Notably, either removal of mature microRNAs or pharmacological blockage of signalling pathways drives PSCs into a low-noise ground state characterized by a reconfigured pluripotency network, enhanced self-renewal and a distinct chromatin state, an effect mediated by opposing microRNA families acting on the Myc/Lin28/let-7 axis.

	abstract = {The gene encoding the secreted protein Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is expressed in the polarizing region (or zone of polarizing activity), a small group of mesenchyme cells at the posterior margin of the vertebrate limb bud. Detailed analyses have revealed that Shh has the properties of the long sought after polarizing region morphogen that specifies positional values across the antero-posterior axis (e.g., thumb to little finger axis) of the limb. Shh has also been shown to control the width of the limb bud by stimulating mesenchyme cell proliferation and by regulating the antero-posterior length of the apical ectodermal ridge, the signaling region required for limb bud outgrowth and the laying down of structures along the proximo-distal axis (e.g., shoulder to digits axis) of the limb. It has been shown that Shh signaling can specify antero-posterior positional values in limb buds in both a concentration- (paracrine) and time-dependent (autocrine) fashion. Currently there are several models for how Shh specifies positional values over time in the limb buds of chick and mouse embryos and how this is integrated with growth. Extensive work has elucidated downstream transcriptional targets of Shh signaling. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how antero-posterior positional values are encoded and then interpreted to give the particular structure appropriate to that position, for example, the type of digit. A distant cis-regulatory enhancer controls limb-bud-specific expression of Shh and the discovery of increasing numbers of interacting transcription factors indicate complex spatiotemporal regulation. Altered Shh signaling is implicated in clinical conditions with congenital limb defects and in the evolution of the morphological diversity of vertebrate limbs.},

We sought to quantitatively investigate the extent to which the occurrence of molecular fluctuations within single cells (biochemical noise) could explain the variation of gene expression levels between cells in a genetically identical population (phenotypic noise). We have isolated the biochemical contribution to phenotypic noise from that of other noise sources by carrying out a series of differential measurements. We varied independently the rates of transcription and translation of a single fluorescent reporter gene in the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis, and we quantitatively measured the resulting changes in the phenotypic noise characteristics. We report that of these two parameters, increased translational efficiency is the predominant source of increased phenotypic noise. This effect is consistent with a stochastic model of gene expression in which proteins are produced in random and sharp bursts. Our results thus provide the first direct experimental evidence of the biochemical origin of phenotypic noise, demonstrating that the level of phenotypic variation in an isogenic population can be regulated by genetic parameters.},

The inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes such as transcription and translation generates “intrinsic” noise. In addition, fluctuations in the amounts or states of other cellular components lead indirectly to variation in the expression of a particular gene and thus represent “extrinsic” noise. Here, we show how the total variation in the level of expression of a given gene can be decomposed into its intrinsic and extrinsic components. We demonstrate theoretically that simultaneous measurement of two identical genes per cell enables discrimination of these two types of noise. Analytic expressions for intrinsic noise are given for a model that involves all the major steps in transcription and translation. These expressions give the sensitivity to various parameters, quantify the deviation from Poisson statistics, and provide a way of fitting experiment. Transcription dominates the intrinsic noise when the average number of proteins made per mRNA transcript is greater than ≃2. Below this number, translational effects also become important. Gene replication and cell division, included in the model, cause protein numbers to tend to a limit cycle. We calculate a general form for the extrinsic noise and illustrate it with the particular case of a single fluctuating extrinsic variable—a repressor protein, which acts on the gene of interest. All results are confirmed by stochastic simulation using plausible parameters for Escherichia coli.},

Here we combine computational modelling11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 with fluorescence data generated from multiple promoter–gene inserts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify two major sources of extrinsic variability. One unavoidable source arising from the coupling of gene expression with population dynamics leads to a ubiquitous lower limit for expression variability. A second source, which is modelled as originating from a common upstream transcription factor, exemplifies how regulatory networks can convert noise in upstream regulator expression into extrinsic noise at the output of a target gene9. Our results highlight the importance of the interplay of gene regulatory networks with population heterogeneity for understanding the origins of cellular diversity.},

	abstract = {Because of recent technological developments, single-cell assays such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have become much more widely available and have achieved unprecedented resolution in revealing cell heterogeneity. The extent of intrinsic cell-to-cell variability in gene expression, or single cell expression variability (scEV), has thus been increasingly appreciated. However, it remains unclear whether this variability is functionally important and, if so, what its implications are for multi-cellular organisms. We therefore analyzed multiple scRNA-seq data sets from lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), lung airway epithelial cells (LAECs), and dermal fibroblasts (DFs). For each of the three cell types, we estimated scEV in homogeneous populations of cells; we identified 465, 466, and 291 highly variable genes (HVGs), respectively. These HVGs were enriched with specific functions precisely relevant to the cell types, from which the scRNA-seq data used to identify HVGs were generated—e.g., HVGs identified in lymphoblastoid cells were enriched in cytokine signaling pathways, LAECs collagen formation, and DFs keratinization. Some of the most relevant HVGs were co-expressed across cells under the regulation of few common transcription factors. We also found that scEV is a heritable trait, partially determined by cell donors’ genetic makeups. Furthermore, across genes, especially immune genes, levels of scEV and between-individual variability in gene expression were positively correlated, suggesting a potential link between the two variabilities measured at different organizational levels. Taken together, our results support the “variation is function” hypothesis, which postulates that scEV is required for higher-level system function. Thus, we argue that quantifying and characterizing scEV in relevant cell types may deepen our understating of normal as well as pathological cell processes.},

To test our approach, we use time-resolved expression data of individual human cells and, from this information, predict the stationary cell-to-cell variation in protein levels in a clonal population. For three of the four human genes investigated, the cellular variations in expression level are not due to fluctuations in promoter activity or transcript copy number, but are almost exclusively a consequence of long-term variations of gene regulatory factors or the global cellular state. Moreover, we show that a dynamic description is much more reliable to discriminate extrinsic and intrinsic sources of noise than it is on grounds of cell-cycle averaged descriptions. The excellent agreement between the theoretical predictions and the experimentally measured noise strengths shows that a quantitative description of gene expression noise is indeed possible on the basis of idealized stochastic processes.},

	abstract = {Gene-panel and whole-exome analyses are now standard methodologies for mutation detection in Mendelian disease. However, the diagnostic yield achieved is at best 50\%, leaving the genetic basis for disease unsolved in many individuals. New approaches are thus needed to narrow the diagnostic gap. Whole-genome sequencing is one potential strategy, but it currently has variant-interpretation challenges, particularly for non-coding changes. In this study we focus on transcriptome analysis, specifically total RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), by using monogenetic neuromuscular disorders as proof of principle. We examined a cohort of 25 exome and/or panel “negative” cases and provided genetic resolution in 36\% (9/25). Causative mutations were identified in coding and non-coding exons, as well as in intronic regions, and the mutational pathomechanisms included transcriptional repression, exon skipping, and intron inclusion. We address a key barrier of transcriptome-based diagnostics: the need for source material with disease-representative expression patterns. We establish that blood-based RNA-seq is not adequate for neuromuscular diagnostics, whereas myotubes generated by transdifferentiation from an individual’s fibroblasts accurately reflect the muscle transcriptome and faithfully reveal disease-causing mutations. Our work confirms that RNA-seq can greatly improve diagnostic yield in genetically unresolved cases of Mendelian disease, defines strengths and challenges of the technology, and demonstrates the suitability of cell models for RNA-based diagnostics. Our data set the stage for development of RNA-seq as a powerful clinical diagnostic tool that can be applied to the large population of individuals with undiagnosed, rare diseases and provide a framework for establishing minimally invasive strategies for doing so.},

To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from ’regularized negative binomial regression’, where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the inﬂuence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overﬁt scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation, and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and diﬀerential expression. Our approach can be applied to any UMI-based scRNA-seq dataset and is freely available as part of the R package sctransform, with a direct interface to our single-cell toolkit Seurat.},

Time-lapse live-cell microscopy provides data about short-term fluctuations in promoter activity, and flow cytometry measurements provide data about the long-term kinetics, because isolated subpopulations of cells relax from a relatively narrow distribution of GFP expression back to the original broad distribution of responses. The landscape is obtained from the steady state distribution of GFP expression and connected to a potential-like function using a stochastic differential equation description (Langevin/Fokker–Planck). The range of cell states is constrained by a force that is proportional to the gradient of the potential, and biochemical noise causes movement of cells within the landscape. Analyzing the mean square displacement of GFP intensity changes in live cells indicates that these fluctuations are described by a single diffusion constant in log GFP space. This finding allows application of the Kramers’ model to calculate rates of switching between two attractor states and enables an accurate simulation of the dynamics of relaxation back to the steady state with no adjustable parameters. With this approach, it is possible to use the steady state distribution of phenotypes and a quantitative description of the short-term fluctuations in individual cells to accurately predict the rates at which different phenotypes will arise from an isolated subpopulation of cells.},

The cells can have states with the higher probability ones giving the different cell types. Different cell types correspond to different basins of attractions of the probability landscape. We study how the cells develop from undifferentiated cells to differentiated cells from landscape perspectives. We quantified the Waddington landscape through construction of underlying probability landscape for cell development. We show the developmental process proceeds as moving from undifferentiated to the differentiated basins of attractions. The barrier height of the basins of attractions correlates with the escape time that determines the stability of cell types. We show that the developmental process can be quantitatively described and uncovered by the biological paths on the quantified Waddington landscape from undifferentiated to the differentiated cells. We found the dynamics of the developmental process is controlled by a combination of the gradient and curl force on the landscape. The biological paths often do not follow the steepest descent path on the landscape. The landscape framework also quantifies the possibility of reverse differentiation process such as cell reprogramming from differentiated cells back to the original stem cell. We show that the biological path of reverse differentiation is irreversible and different from the one for differentiation process. We found that the developmental process described by the underlying landscape and the associated biological paths is relatively stable and robust against the influences of environmental perturbations.},

These statistical characterizations of the gene expression distribution are critical for understanding expression variation and for selecting marker genes for population heterogeneity. However, scRNA-seq data are noisy, with each cell typically sequenced at low coverage, thus making it difficult to infer properties of the gene expression distribution from raw counts. Based on a reexamination of nine public datasets, we propose a simple technical noise model for scRNA-seq data with unique molecular identifiers (UMI). We develop deconvolution of single-cell expression distribution (DESCEND), a method that deconvolves the true cross-cell gene expression distribution from observed scRNA-seq counts, leading to improved estimates of properties of the distribution such as dispersion and nonzero fraction. DESCEND can adjust for cell-level covariates such as cell size, cell cycle, and batch effects. DESCEND’s noise model and estimation accuracy are further evaluated through comparisons to RNA FISH data, through data splitting and simulations and through its effectiveness in removing known batch effects. We demonstrate how DESCEND can clarify and improve downstream analyses such as finding differentially expressed genes, identifying cell types, and selecting differentiation markers.},

We study some of the rich dynamical properties of these cyclic Hopfield systems, including the ability of populations of simulated cells to recreate experimental expression data and the effects of noise on the dynamics. Next, we use a genetic algorithm to identify sets of genes which, when selectively inhibited by local external fields representing gene silencing compounds such as kinase inhibitors, disrupt the encoded cell cycle. We find, for example, that inhibiting the set of four kinases AURKB, NEK1, TTK, and WEE1 causes simulated HeLa cells to accumulate in the M phase.

Research in the biology and scientiﬁc computing community has concentrated mostly on the development of numerical techniques to approximate the solution of the CME via many realizations of the associated Markov jump process. The domain of exact and/or efﬁcient methods for directly solving the CME is still widely open, which is due to its large dimension that grows exponentially with the number of molecular species involved. In this article, we present an exact solution formula of the CME for arbitrary initial conditions in the case where the underlying system is governed by monomolecular reactions. The solution can be expressed in terms of the convolution of multinomial and product Poisson distributions with time-dependent parameters evolving according to the traditional reaction-rate equations. This very structured representation allows to deduce easily many properties of the solution. The model class includes many interesting examples. For more complex reaction systems, our results can be seen as a ﬁrst step towards the construction of new numerical integrators, because solutions to the monomolecular case provide promising ansatz functions for Galerkin-type methods.},

Current methods for measuring gene expression in single cells mostly rely on single time point measurements, making the time of a fluctuation of gene expression or c ellular memory difficult to measure. Here, we report a method combining Luria and Delbrück’s fluctuation analysis with population-based RNA sequencing (MemorySeq) for identifying genes transcriptome-wide whose fluctuations persist for several cell divisions. MemorySeq revealed multiple gene modules that express together in rare cells within otherwise homogeneous clonal populations. Further, we found that these rare cell subpopulations are associated with biologically distinct behaviors in multiple different cancer cell lines, for example, the ability to proliferate in the face of anti-cancer therapeutics. The identification of non-genetic, multigenerational fluctuations has the potential to reveal new forms of biological memory at the level of single cells and suggests that non-genetic heritability of cellular state may be a quantitative property.},

To uncover regulatory mechanisms in Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, we conducted genome-wide screens to identify positive and negative pathway components and validated top hits using multiple signaling and differentiation assays in two different cell types. Most positive regulators identified in our screens, including Rab34, Pdcl, and Tubd1, were involved in ciliary functions, confirming the central role for primary cilia in Hh signaling. Negative regulators identified included Megf8, Mgrn1, and an unannotated gene encoding a tetraspan protein we named Atthog. The function of these negative regulators converged on Smoothened (SMO), an oncoprotein that transduces the Hh signal across the membrane. In the absence of Atthog, SMO was stabilized at the cell surface and concentrated in the ciliary membrane, boosting cell sensitivity to the ligand Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and consequently altering SHH-guided neural cell-fate decisions. Thus, we uncovered genes that modify the interpretation of morphogen signals by regulating protein-trafficking events in target cells.},

Recent advances in DNA technology and companies that provide array-based testing have led to services that collect, share, and analyze volunteered genomic information. Privacy concerns have been raised, especially in light of the use of these services by law enforcement to identify suspects in criminal cases. Testing models of relatedness, Erlich et al. show that many individuals of European ancestry in the United States—even those that have not undergone genetic testing—can be identified on the basis of available genetic information. These results indicate a need for procedures to help maintain genetic privacy for individuals.
Science, this issue p. 690
Consumer genomics databases have reached the scale of millions of individuals. Recently, law enforcement authorities have exploited some of these databases to identify suspects via distant familial relatives. Using genomic data of 1.28 million individuals tested with consumer genomics, we investigated the power of this technique. We project that about 60\% of the searches for individuals of European descent will result in a third-cousin or closer match, which theoretically allows their identification using demographic identifiers. Moreover, the technique could implicate nearly any U.S. individual of European descent in the near future. We demonstrate that the technique can also identify research participants of a public sequencing project. On the basis of these results, we propose a potential mitigation strategy and policy implications for human subject research.

	abstract = {Transcriptional positive-feedback loops are widely associated with bistability, characterized by two stable expression states that allow cells to respond to analog signals in a digital manner. Using a synthetic system in budding yeast, we show that positive feedback involving a promoter with multiple transcription factor (TF) binding sites can induce a steady-state bimodal response without cooperative binding of the TF. Deterministic models of this system do not predict bistability. Rather, the bimodal response requires a short-lived TF and stochastic fluctuations in the TF’s expression. Multiple binding sites provide these fluctuations. Because many promoters possess multiple binding sites and many TFs are unstable, positive-feedback loops in gene regulatory networks may exhibit bimodal responses, but not necessarily because of deterministic bistability, as is commonly thought.
Noise induced by multiple binding sites, rather than deterministic bistability, may cause bimodal gene expression in yeast.

Stochastic fluctuations, or 'noise', in gene expression propagate through active, but not inactive, regulatory links1,2. Thus, correlations in gene expression noise could provide a noninvasive means to probe the activity states of regulatory links. However, global, 'extrinsic', noise sources generate correlations even without direct regulatory links. Here we show that single-cell time-lapse microscopy, by revealing time lags due to regulation, can discriminate between active regulatory connections and extrinsic noise. We demonstrate this principle mathematically, using stochastic modeling, and experimentally, using simple synthetic gene circuits. We then use this approach to analyze dynamic noise correlations in the galactose metabolism genes of Escherichia coli. We find that the CRP-GalS-GalE feed-forward loop is inactive in standard conditions but can become active in a GalR mutant. These results show how noise can help analyze the context dependence of regulatory interactions in endogenous gene circuits.},

Gene expression analysis demonstrated higher expression of RA-target genes in RA-CFPdim HSCs, in contrast to the RA-CFP reporter expression, but both RA-CFP-dim and RA-CFPbright HSCs responded efﬁciently to RA in vitro. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of {\textgreater}1,200 HSCs showed that differences in cell cycle activity constituted the main driver of transcriptional heterogeneity in HSCs. Moreover, further analysis of the single-cell RNA-seq data revealed that stochastic low-level expression of distinct lineage-afﬁliated transcriptional programs is a common feature of HSCs.

Although recent advances have improved our ability to document cellular phenotypic variation4,5,6,7,8, the fundamental mechanisms that generate variability from identical DNA sequences remain elusive. Here we reveal the landscape and principles of mammalian DNA regulatory variation by developing a robust method for mapping the accessible genome of individual cells by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq)9 integrated into a programmable microfluidics platform. Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) maps from hundreds of single cells in aggregate closely resemble accessibility profiles from tens of millions of cells and provide insights into cell-to-cell variation. Accessibility variance is systematically associated with specific trans-factors and cis-elements, and we discover combinations of trans-factors associated with either induction or suppression of cell-to-cell variability. We further identify sets of trans-factors associated with cell-type-specific accessibility variance across eight cell types. Targeted perturbations of cell cycle or transcription factor signalling evoke stimulus-specific changes in this observed variability. The pattern of accessibility variation in cis across the genome recapitulates chromosome compartments10 de novo, linking single-cell accessibility variation to three-dimensional genome organization. Single-cell analysis of DNA accessibility provides new insight into cellular variation of the ‘regulome’.},

The cell cycle, in particular, is thought to be a key driver of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression, even in otherwise homogeneous cell populations. Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) facilitate detailed characterization of gene expression heterogeneity, and can thus shed new light on the processes driving heterogeneity. Here, we combined ﬂuorescence imaging with scRNA-seq to measure cell cycle phase and gene expression levels in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Using these data, we developed a novel approach to characterize cell cycle progression. While standard methods assign cells to discrete cell cycle stages, our method goes beyond this, and quantiﬁes cell cycle progression on a continuum. We found that, on average, scRNA-seq data from only ﬁve genes predicted a cell’s position on the cell cycle continuum to within 14\% of the entire cycle, and that using more genes did not improve this accuracy. Our data and predictor of cell cycle phase can directly help future studies to account for cell-cycle-related heterogeneity in iPSCs. Our results and methods also provide a foundation for future work to characterize the eﬀects of the cell cycle on expression heterogeneity in other cell types.},

Unlike resistant mutants, cells regrown from such persistent bacteria remain sensitive to the antibiotic. We investigated the persistence of single cells of Escherichia coli with the use of microfluidic devices. Persistence was linked to preexisting heterogeneity in bacterial populations because phenotypic switching occurred between normally growing cells and persister cells having reduced growth rates. Quantitative measurements led to a simple mathematical description of the persistence switch. Inherent heterogeneity of bacterial populations may be important in adaptation to fluctuating environments and in the persistence of bacterial infections.
In a bacterial population, a few members that shift to a slow growth rate can survive antibiotic treatment.

We introduce a model that relates the source of mutations to their accumulation with cell divisions, providing a framework for understanding how mutation rates depend on sex, age, and cell division rate. We show that the accrual of mutations should track cell divisions not only when mutations are replicative in origin but also when they are non-replicative and repaired efficiently. One implication is that observations from diverse fields that to date have been interpreted as pointing to a replicative origin of most mutations could instead reflect the accumulation of mutations arising from endogenous reactions or exogenous mutagens. We further find that only mutations that arise from inefficiently repaired lesions will accrue according to absolute time; thus, unless life history traits co-vary, the phylogenetic “molecular clock” should not be expected to run steadily across species.},

For example, cytoplasmic aggregates of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 are observed in 97\% of cases of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)6,7. However, it is still unclear for ALS and other diseases whether it is the insoluble aggregates or other forms of the mutated proteins that cause these diseases that are actually toxic to cells8–13. Here we address this question for TDP-43 by systematically mutating14 the protein and quantifying the effects on cellular toxicity. We generated {\textgreater}50,000 mutations in the intrinsically disordered prion-like domain (PRD) and observed that changes in hydrophobicity and aggregation potential are highly predictive of changes in toxicity. Surprisingly, however, increased hydrophobicity and cytoplasmic aggregation actually reduce cellular toxicity. Mutations have their strongest effects in a central region of the PRD, with variants that increase toxicity promoting the formation of more dynamic liquidlike condensates. The genetic interactions in double mutants reveal that specific structures exist in this ‘unstructured’ region in vivo. Our results demonstrate that deep mutagenesis is a powerful approach for probing the sequence-function relationships of intrinsically disordered proteins as well as their in vivo structural conformations. Moreover, we show that aggregation of TDP-43 is not harmful but actually protects cells, most likely by titrating the protein away from a toxic liquid-like phase.},

This question is particularly relevant to the highly differentiated organization of the brain. In this study, for the first time, we analyze the in vivo variability within a neuronal phenotype in terms of input type. We developed a large-scale gene-expression data set from several hundred single brainstem neurons selected on the basis of their specific synaptic input types. The results show a surprising organizational structure in which neuronal variability aligned with input type along a continuum of sub-phenotypes and corresponding gene regulatory modules. Correlations between these regulatory modules and specific cellular states were stratified by synaptic input type. Moreover, we found that the phenotype gradient and correlated regulatory modules were maintained across subjects. As these specific cellular states are a function of the inputs received, the stability of these states represents “attractor”-like states along a dynamic landscape that is influenced and shaped by inputs, enabling distinct state-dependent functional responses. We interpret the phenotype gradient as arising from analog tuning of underlying regulatory networks driven by distinct inputs to individual cells. Our results change the way we understand how a phenotypic population supports robust biological function by integrating the environmental experience of individual cells. Our results provide an explanation of the functional significance of the pervasive variability observed within a cell type and are broadly applicable to understanding the relationship between cellular input history and cell phenotype within all tissues.},

To develop such a framework, we assayed the transcriptome in 62,600 single cells from the testes of wildtype mice, and mice with gonadal defects due to disruption of the genes Mlh3, Hormad1, Cul4a or Cnp. The resulting expression atlas of distinct cell clusters revealed novel markers and new insights into testis gene regulation. By jointly analysing mutant and wildtype cells using a model-based factor analysis method, SDA, we decomposed our data into 46 components that identify novel meiotic gene regulatory programmes, mutant-specific pathological processes, and technical effects. Moreover, we identify, de novo, DNA sequence motifs associated with each component, and show that SDA can be used to impute expression values from single cell data. Analysis of SDA components also led us to identify a rare population of macrophages within the seminiferous tubules of Mlh3-/and Hormad1-/- testes, an area typically associated with immune privilege.

We used the empirical long-term gill-net time series and a negative binomial linear mixed model to partition the variability in catches into spatial and coherent temporal variance components, hypothesizing that variance partitioning can help quantify spatiotemporal variability and determine whether variance structure differs before and after large-scale perturbations. We found that the mean catch and the total variability of catches decreased following perturbation but that not all sampling locations responded in a consistent manner. There was also evidence of some spatial homogenization concurrent with a restructuring of the relative productivity of individual sites. Specifically, offshore sites generally became more productive following the estimated break point in the gill-net time series. These results provide support for the idea that variance structure is responsive to large-scale perturbations; therefore, variance components have potential utility as statistical indicators of response to a changing environment more broadly. The modeling approach described herein is flexible and would be transferable to other systems and metrics. For example, variance partitioning could be used to examine responses to alternative management regimes, to compare variability across physiographic regions, and to describe differences among climate zones. Understanding how individual variance components respond to perturbation may yield finer-scale insights into ecological shifts than focusing on patterns in the mean responses or total variability alone.Received July 26, 2016; accepted February 28, 2017 Published online April 25, 2017},

This developmental process is bistable, and only a subpopulation of cells actually differentiates into endospores. Why a cell decides to sporulate or not to do so is poorly understood. Here, through the use of time-lapse microscopy, we follow the growth, division, and differentiation of individual cells to identify elements of cell history and ancestry that could affect this decision process. These analyses show that during microcolony development, B. subtilis uses a bet-hedging strategy whereby some cells sporulate while others use alternative metabolites to continue growth, providing the latter subpopulation with a reproductive advantage. We demonstrate that B. subtilis is subject to aging. Nevertheless, the age of the cell plays no role in the decision of its fate. However, the physiological state of the cell's ancestor (more than two generations removed) does affect the outcome of cellular differentiation. We show that this epigenetic inheritance is based on positive feedback within the sporulation phosphorelay. The extended intergenerational “memory” caused by this autostimulatory network may be important for the development of multicellular structures such as fruiting bodies and biofilms.},

The cell cycle, in particular, is thought to be a key driver of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression, even in otherwise homogeneous cell populations. Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) facilitate detailed characterization of gene expression heterogeneity, and can thus shed new light on the processes driving heterogeneity. Here, we combined fluorescence imaging with scRNA-seq to measure cell cycle phase and gene expression levels in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Using these data, we developed a novel approach to characterize cell cycle progression. While standard methods assign cells to discrete cell cycle stages, our method goes beyond this, and quantifies cell cycle progression on a continuum. We found that, on average, scRNA-seq data from only five genes predicted a cell’s position on the cell cycle continuum to within 14\% of the entire cycle, and that using more genes did not improve this accuracy. Our data and predictor of cell cycle phase can directly help future studies to account for cell-cycle-related heterogeneity in iPSCs. Our results and methods also provide a foundation for future work to characterize the effects of the cell cycle on expression heterogeneity in other cell types.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In order to examine the consequences of gene expression variability in multicellular organisms, we studied intestinal specification in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans in which wild-type cell fate is invariant and controlled by a small transcriptional network. Mutations in elements of this network can have indeterminate effects: some mutant embryos fail to develop intestinal cells, while others produce intestinal precursors. By counting transcripts of the genes in this network in individual embryos, we show that the expression of an otherwise redundant gene becomes highly variable in the mutants and that this variation is thresholded to produce an ON/OFF expression pattern of the master regulatory gene of intestinal differentiation. Our results demonstrate that mutations in developmental networks can expose otherwise buffered stochastic variability in gene expression, leading to pronounced phenotypic variation.},

Here, we use quantitative expression measurements and thermodynamic modeling to uncover the cis-regulatory logic underlying spatially restricted gene expression in a Hedgehog (Hh) gradient in Drosophila. When Hh signaling is low, the Hh effector Gli, known as Cubitus interruptus (Ci) in Drosophila, acts as a transcriptional repressor; when Hh signaling is high, Gli acts as a transcriptional activator. Counterintuitively and in contrast to previous models of Gli-regulated gene expression, we found that low-affinity binding sites for Ci were required for proper spatial expression of the Hh target gene decapentaplegic (dpp) in regions of low Hh signal. Three low-affinity Ci sites enabled expression of dpp in response to low signal; increasing the affinity of these sites restricted dpp expression to regions of maximal signaling. A model incorporating cooperative repression by Ci correctly predicted the in vivo expression of a reporter gene controlled by a single Ci site. Our work clarifies how transcriptional activators and repressors, competing for common binding sites, can transmit positional information to the genome. It also provides an explanation for the widespread presence of conserved, nonconsensus Gli binding sites in Hh target genes.
Reporter gene assays in Drosophila and modeling reveal mechanisms that control transcriptional responses to gradients of Hedgehog ligands.

While modeling the acute response to various anticancer agents in drug-sensitive human tumor cell lines, we consistently detected a small subpopulation of reversibly "drug-tolerant" cells. These cells demonstrate {\textgreater}100-fold reduced drug sensitivity and maintain viability via engagement of IGF-1 receptor signaling and an altered chromatin state that requires the histone demethylase RBP2/KDM5A/Jarid1A. This drug-tolerant phenotype is transiently acquired and relinquished at low frequency by individual cells within the population, implicating the dynamic regulation of phenotypic heterogeneity in drug tolerance. The drug-tolerant subpopulation can be selectively ablated by treatment with IGF-1 receptor inhibitors or chromatin-modifying agents, potentially yielding a therapeutic opportunity. Together, these findings suggest that cancer cell populations employ a dynamic survival strategy in which individual cells transiently assume a reversibly drug-tolerant state to protect the population from eradication by potentially lethal exposures.},

This variability can come from differential regulation related to cell state (extrinsic) and allele-specific transcriptional bursting (intrinsic). Yet, the relative contribution of these two distinct sources is unknown. Here we exploit the qualitative difference in the patterns of covariance between these two sources to quantify their relative contributions to expression variance in mammalian cells. Using multiplexed error robust RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (MERFISH) we measured the multivariate gene expression distribution of 150 genes related to Ca2 + signaling coupled with the dynamic Ca2 + response of live cells to ATP. We show that after controlling for cellular phenotypic states such as size, cell cycle stage, and Ca2 + response to ATP, the remaining variability is effectively at the Poisson limit for most genes. These findings demonstrate that the majority of expression variability results from cell state differences and that the contribution of transcriptional bursting is relatively minimal.},

	abstract = {During fetal development, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) undergo a remarkable expansion through a combination of rapid proliferation and high rates of self-renewal. In contrast, adult HSCs are characterized by long-term quiescence. Understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these ontogeny-dependent differences in cell cycle and self-renewal is hampered by marked heterogeneity within the HSC compartment, making it difficult to distinguish overlapping signatures in bulk transcriptional data. Advances in single cell genomics provide a new opportunity to tease apart different sources of gene expression heterogeneity, including those relating to cell cycle and self-renewal capability.
To address these questions, and improve resolution for cell-cycle annotation of individual HSCs, we developed an integrated single cell (sc)RNA-seq and live cell-cycle staining technique using Hoechst 33342 (DNA) and Pyronin-y (RNA) based FACS index sorting, followed by smart-seq2 based scRNA-seq. We validated our approach on 4 hematopoietic cell lines from mouse and human, using these data as a training set to apply a novel integrated pseudotime package that orders single cells by stage of cell cycle rather than developmental trajectory. By this approach we detected non-canonical cell cycle genes not apparent through bulk sorting of distinct cell cycle phases, and not previously annotated in published cell cycle gene sets (sc-pseudotime genes = 665, FDR {\textless} 0.05; non-annotated cell cycle = 487; non-bulk detected = 570).
We then applied our technique to analyze primary mouse HSCs from 3 developmental time points (e15.5 fetal liver (FL), 2 week old bone marrow, and 6 week old adult bone marrow (ABM), n {\textgreater}1,500 single cells). Our cell cycle based integrated pseudotime analysis revealed distinct cell cycle signatures for FL, ABM, and common cell cycle related transcripts across distinct developmental time points that have not previously been described, including 555 unique cell cycle genes in FL; 401 unique cell cycle genes in ABM, and 93 novel cell cycle genes in common to both developmental time points e.g. Pclaf, Zfp367 and including long non-coding RNAs e.g. Lockd (FDR {\textless} 0.001).
Our dataset uniquely allowed us to explore ontogeny related molecular signatures without the overriding effect of confounding cell cycle associated gene expression by directly comparing non-mitotic cells from FL and ABM groups. We identified 404 differentially expressed transcripts (FDR {\textless}0.001, {\textgreater}2FC), including genes of unknown HSC function (e.g., FL: Lgals1, Gmfg; ABM: Zfp36l1, Rgs1). Single cell qPCR confirmed aberrant expression of 26/29 (89.7\%) selected ontogeny candidate genes. Furthermore, hallmark gene set enrichment analysis revealed upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation, MYC targets, and E2F targets in FL; and TNFA signaling, Hypoxia, and TGF-beta signaling, among others, in ABM (FDR {\textless}0.01, NES {\textgreater} 1.5).
We then functionally reversed ABM quiescence through in vivo 5-FU treatment, and performed our single cell RNA-seq analysis on HSCs both 2 and 6 days post injection. This allowed us to identify genes and pathways associated with selective resistance of HSCs to chemotherapy, including upregulation of the hallmark gene sets for unfolded protein response, fatty acid metabolism, and MTOR signaling (FDR {\textless} 0.01, NES {\textgreater} 1.5 for each set).
To functionally validate novel ontogeny related genes we utilized genetic mouse models for two unexplored ABM related genes, Zfp36L1, an RNA-binding zinc finger protein, and Rgs1 a regulator of G-protein coupled signaling. We transplanted Cre-ERT2 conditionally floxed Zfp36L1 bone marrow with CD45.1 competitor control and induced deletion by tamoxifen four weeks post transplant. Compared to the initial four-week post transplant time point we observed a significant reduction in chimerism from Zfp36L1 deleted bone marrow compared to Cre-ERT2 control (p {\textless} .05). Competitive transplantation of Rgs1 -/- and WT bone marrow at a 1:1 ratio with CD45.1 competitors resulted in significantly reduced myeloid chimerism at 16 weeks post transplant. Secondary transplant and single cell cycle molecular analysis of these mice are ongoing together with functional validation of a number of other candidate genes.
Our results demonstrate the utility of single cell analysis to discover novel HSC regulators providing a unique dataset for further studies investigating regulators of HSC function.

Through cooperative self-assembly, these complexes perform nonlinear regulatory operations involved in cellular decision-making and signal processing. In this study, we apply this design principle to synthetic networks, testing whether engineered cooperative assemblies can program nonlinear gene circuit behavior in yeast. Using a model-guided approach, we show that specifying the strength and number of assembly subunits enables predictive tuning between linear and nonlinear regulatory responses for single- and multi-input circuits. We demonstrate that assemblies can be adjusted to control circuit dynamics. We harness this capability to engineer circuits that perform dynamic filtering, enabling frequency-dependent decoding in cell populations. Programmable cooperative assembly provides a versatile way to tune the nonlinearity of network connections, markedly expanding the engineerable behaviors available to synthetic circuits.},

It is now necessary to turn attention towards understanding how these sites work in combination to influence gene expression. Quantitative models that accurately predict gene expression from promoter sequence3,4,5 will be a crucial part of solving this problem. Here we present such a model, based on the analysis of synthetic promoter libraries in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Thermodynamic models based only on the equilibrium binding of transcription factors to DNA and to each other captured a large fraction of the variation in expression in every library. Thermodynamic analysis of these libraries uncovered several phenomena in our system, including cooperativity and the effects of weak binding sites. When applied to the S. cerevisiae genome, a model of repression by Mig1 (which was trained on synthetic promoters) predicts a number of Mig1-regulated genes that lack significant Mig1-binding sites in their promoters. The success of the thermodynamic approach suggests that the information encoded by combinations of cis-regulatory sites is interpreted primarily through simple protein–DNA and protein–protein interactions, with complicated biochemical reactions—such as nucleosome modifications—being downstream events. Quantitative analyses of synthetic promoter libraries will be an important tool in unravelling the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation.},

	abstract = {On induction of cell differentiation, distinct cell phenotypes are encoded by complex genetic networks1,2,3. These networks can prevent the reversion of established phenotypes even in the presence of significant fluctuations. Here we explore the key parameters that determine the stability of cellular memory by using the yeast galactose-signalling network as a model system. This network contains multiple nested feedback loops. Of the two positive feedback loops, only the loop mediated by the cytoplasmic signal transducer Gal3p is able to generate two stable expression states with a persistent memory of previous galactose consumption states. The parallel loop mediated by the galactose transporter Gal2p only increases the expression difference between the two states. A negative feedback through the inhibitor Gal80p reduces the strength of the core positive feedback. Despite this, a constitutive increase in the Gal80p concentration tunes the system from having destabilized memory to having persistent memory. A model reveals that fluctuations are trapped more efficiently at higher Gal80p concentrations. Indeed, the rate at which single cells randomly switch back and forth between expression states was reduced. These observations provide a quantitative understanding of the stability and reversibility of cellular differentiation states.},

A population might enhance its fitness by allowing individual cells to stochastically transition among multiple phenotypes, thus ensuring that some cells are always prepared for an unforeseen environmental fluctuation. Here we experimentally explore how switching affects population growth by using the galactose utilization network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We engineered a strain that randomly transitions between two phenotypes as a result of stochastic gene expression5,6,7,8,9. Each phenotype was designed to confer a growth advantage over the other phenotype in a certain environment. When we compared the growth of two populations with different switching rates, we found that fast-switching populations outgrow slow switchers when the environment fluctuates rapidly, whereas slow-switching phenotypes outgrow fast switchers when the environment changes rarely. These results suggest that cells may tune inter-phenotype switching rates to the frequency of environmental changes.},

Traditional statistical methods for computing low-dimensional or hidden representations of these data sets, such as principal component analysis and independent component analysis, ignore the underlying network structures and provide decompositions based purely on a priori statistical constraints on the computed component signals. The resulting decomposition thus provides a phenomenological model for the observed data and does not necessarily contain physically or biologically meaningful signals. Here, we develop a method, called network component analysis, for uncovering hidden regulatory signals from outputs of networked systems, when only a partial knowledge of the underlying network topology is available. The a priori network structure information is first tested for compliance with a set of identifiability criteria. For networks that satisfy the criteria, the signals from the regulatory nodes and their strengths of influence on each output node can be faithfully reconstructed. This method is first validated experimentally by using the absorbance spectra of a network of various hemoglobin species. The method is then applied to microarray data generated from yeast Saccharamyces cerevisiae and the activities of various transcription factors during cell cycle are reconstructed by using recently discovered connectivity information for the underlying transcriptional regulatory networks.},

              protein product encoded by one gene often regulates expression of
              other genes. The time delay, after activation of the first
              promoter, to reach an effective level to control the next
              promoter depends on the rate of protein accumulation. We have
              analyzed the chemical reactions controlling transcript initiation
              and translation termination in a single such ``genetically
              coupled'' link as a precursor to modeling networks constructed
              from many such links. Simulation of the processes of gene

              promoter in short bursts of variable numbers of proteins that
              occur at random time intervals. As a result, there can be large

              during mammalian pre-implantation development, resulting in the
              formation of the naive epiblast. Reprogramming involves both the
              resetting of epigenetic marks and the activation of
              pluripotent-cell-specific genes such as Nanog and Oct4 (also
              known as Pou5f1). The tight regulation of these genes is crucial
              for reprogramming, but the mechanisms that regulate their
              expression in vivo have not been uncovered. Here we show that
              Nanog--but not Oct4--is monoallelically expressed in early
              pre-implantation embryos. Nanog then undergoes a progressive
              switch to biallelic expression during the transition towards
              ground-state pluripotency in the naive epiblast of the late
              blastocyst. Embryonic stem (ES) cells grown in leukaemia
              inhibitory factor (LIF) and serum express Nanog mainly
              monoallelically and show asynchronous replication of the Nanog
              locus, a feature of monoallelically expressed genes, but ES cells
              activate both alleles when cultured under 2i conditions, which
              mimic the pluripotent ground state in vitro. Live-cell imaging
              with reporter ES cells confirmed the allelic expression of Nanog
              and revealed allelic switching. The allelic expression of Nanog
              is regulated through the fibroblast growth factor-extracellular
              signal-regulated kinase signalling pathway, and it is accompanied
              by chromatin changes at the proximal promoter but occurs
              independently of DNA methylation. Nanog-heterozygous blastocysts
              have fewer inner-cell-mass derivatives and delayed primitive
              endoderm formation, indicating a role for the biallelic
              expression of Nanog in the timely maturation of the inner cell
              mass into a fully reprogrammed pluripotent epiblast. We suggest
              that the tight regulation of Nanog dose at the chromosome level
              is necessary for the acquisition of ground-state pluripotency
              during development. Our data highlight an unexpected role for
              allelic expression in controlling the dose of pluripotency

              slow or zero expression deactivation rates (stable gene

              static and dynamic measurements in single cells has been largely
              attributed to random periods of transcription, often occurring in
              bursts. The cell cycle has a pronounced global role in affecting
              transcriptional and translational output, but how this influences
              transcriptional statistics from noisy promoters is unknown and
              generally ignored by current stochastic models. Here we show that
              variable transcription from the synthetic tetO promoter in S.
              cerevisiae is dominated by its dependence on the cell cycle.
              Real-time measurements of fluorescent protein at high expression
              levels indicate tetO promoters increase transcription rate
              ∼2-fold in S/G2/M similar to constitutive genes. At low
              expression levels, where tetO promoters are thought to generate
              infrequent bursts of transcription, we observe random pulses of
              expression restricted to S/G2/M, which are correlated between
              homologous promoters present in the same cell. The analysis of
              static, single-cell mRNA measurements at different points along
              the cell cycle corroborates these findings. Our results
              demonstrate that highly variable mRNA distributions in yeast are
              not solely the result of randomly switching between periods of
              active and inactive gene expression, but instead largely driven

              stem cell marker Sca-1 (also known as Ly6a; ref. 9) reconstitute
              the parental distribution of Sca-1 but do so only after more than
              one week. This slow relaxation is described by a gaussian mixture
              model that incorporates noise-driven transitions between discrete
              subpopulations, suggesting hidden multi-stability within one cell
              type. Despite clonality, the Sca-1 outliers had distinct
              transcriptomes. Although their unique gene expression profiles
              eventually reverted to that of the median cells, revealing an
              attractor state, they lasted long enough to confer a greatly
              different proclivity for choosing either the erythroid or the
              myeloid lineage. Preference in lineage choice was associated with
              increased expression of lineage-specific transcription factors,
              such as a >200-fold increase in Gata1 (ref. 10) among the
              erythroid-prone cells, or a >15-fold increased PU.1 (Sfpi1) (ref.
              11) expression among myeloid-prone cells. Thus, clonal
              heterogeneity of gene expression level is not due to independent
              noise in the expression of individual genes, but reflects
              metastable states of a slowly fluctuating transcriptome that is
              distinct in individual cells and may govern the reversible,

              intrinsically noisy, being dominated by large concentration
              fluctuations1,2,3. This intrinsic noise has been implicated in
              the random lysis/lysogeny decision of bacteriophage-$\lambda$4,
              in the loss of synchrony of circadian clocks5,6 and in the
              decrease of precision of cell signals7. We sought to
              quantitatively investigate the extent to which the occurrence of

              could explain the variation of gene expression levels between
              cells in a genetically identical population (phenotypic noise).
              We have isolated the biochemical contribution to phenotypic noise
              from that of other noise sources by carrying out a series of
              differential measurements. We varied independently the rates of
              transcription and translation of a single fluorescent reporter
              gene in the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis, and we
              quantitatively measured the resulting changes in the phenotypic
              noise characteristics. We report that of these two parameters,
              increased translational efficiency is the predominant source of
              increased phenotypic noise. This effect is consistent with a
              stochastic model of gene expression in which proteins are
              produced in random and sharp bursts. Our results thus provide the

              Using single-molecule counting and computational image analysis,
              we show that transcript abundance correlates with cellular volume
              at the single-cell level due to increased global transcription in

              alternative state and, after some time, switch back again. In
              Bacillus subtilis, competence is an example of such a transiently
              differentiated state associated with the capability for DNA
              uptake from the environment. Individual genes and proteins
              underlying differentiation into the competent state have been
              identified, but it has been unclear how these genes interact
              dynamically in individual cells to control both spontaneous entry
              into competence and return to vegetative growth. Here we show
              that this behaviour can be understood in terms of excitability in
              the underlying genetic circuit. Using quantitative fluorescence
              time-lapse microscopy, we directly observed the activities of
              multiple circuit components simultaneously in individual cells,

              We find that an excitable core module containing positive and
              negative feedback loops can explain both entry into, and exit
              from, the competent state. We further tested this model by
              analysing initiation in sister cells, and by re-engineering the
              gene circuit to specifically block exit. Excitable dynamics
              driven by noise naturally generate stochastic and transient

              proteins. We investigated the origins of these variations in
              mammalian cells by counting individual molecules of mRNA produced
              from a reporter gene that was stably integrated into the cell's
              genome. We found that there are massive variations in the number
              of mRNA molecules present in each cell. These variations occur
              because mRNAs are synthesized in short but intense bursts of
              transcription beginning when the gene transitions from an
              inactive to an active state and ending when they transition back
              to the inactive state. We show that these transitions are
              intrinsically random and not due to global, extrinsic factors
              such as the levels of transcriptional activators. Moreover, the
              gene activation causes burst-like expression of all genes within
              a wider genomic locus. We further found that bursts are also
              exhibited in the synthesis of natural genes. The bursts of mRNA
              expression can be buffered at the protein level by slow protein
              degradation rates. A stochastic model of gene activation and

  abstract = "Cellular heterogeneity, which plays an essential role in
              biological phenomena, such as drug resistance and migration, is
              considered to arise from intrinsic (i.e., reaction kinetics) and
              extrinsic (i.e., protein variability) noise in the cell. However,
              the mechanistic effects of these types of noise to determine the
              heterogeneity of signal responses have not been elucidated. Here,
              we report that the output of epidermal growth factor (EGF)
              signaling activity is modulated by cellular noise, particularly
              by extrinsic noise of particular signaling components in the
              pathway. We developed a mathematical model of the EGF signaling
              pathway incorporating regulation between extracellular
              signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and nuclear pore complex (NPC),
              which is necessary for switch-like activation of the nuclear ERK
              response. As the threshold of switch-like behavior is more
              sensitive to perturbations than the graded response, the effect
              of biological noise is potentially critical for cell fate
              decision. Our simulation analysis indicated that extrinsic noise,
              but not intrinsic noise, contributes to cell-to-cell
              heterogeneity of nuclear ERK. In addition, we accurately
              estimated variations in abundance of the signal proteins between
              individual cells by direct comparison of experimental data with
              simulation results using Apparent Measurement Error (AME). AME
              was constant regardless of whether the protein levels varied in a
              correlated manner, while covariation among proteins influenced
              cell-to-cell heterogeneity of nuclear ERK, suppressing the
              variation. Simulations using the estimated protein abundances
              showed that each protein species has different effects on
              cell-to-cell variation in the nuclear ERK response. In
              particular, variability of EGF receptor, Ras, Raf, and MEK
              strongly influenced cellular heterogeneity, while others did not.
              Overall, our results indicated that cellular heterogeneity in
              response to EGF is strongly driven by extrinsic noise, and that
              such heterogeneity results from variability of particular protein
              species that function as sensitive nodes, which may contribute to
              the pathogenesis of human diseases.",

              growth is central to understanding phenotypic heterogeneity and
              the stability of cellular proliferation. The inherent
              stochasticity of metabolic reaction events should have negligible
              effect, because of averaging over the many reaction events
              contributing to growth. Indeed, metabolism and growth are often
              considered to be constant for fixed conditions. Stochastic
              fluctuations in the expression level of metabolic enzymes could
              produce variations in the reactions they catalyse. However,
              whether such molecular fluctuations can affect growth is unclear,
              given the various stabilizing regulatory mechanisms, the slow
              adjustment of key cellular components such as ribosomes, and the
              secretion and buffering of excess metabolites. Here we use
              time-lapse microscopy to measure fluctuations in the
              instantaneous growth rate of single cells of Escherichia coli,
              and quantify time-resolved cross-correlations with the expression
              of lac genes and enzymes in central metabolism. We show that
              expression fluctuations of catabolically active enzymes can
              propagate and cause growth fluctuations, with transmission
              depending on the limitation of the enzyme to growth. Conversely,
              growth fluctuations propagate back to perturb expression.
              Accordingly, enzymes were found to transmit noise to other
              unrelated genes via growth. Homeostasis is promoted by a
              noise-cancelling mechanism that exploits fluctuations in the
              dilution of proteins by cell-volume expansion. The results
              indicate that molecular noise is propagated not only by
              regulatory proteins but also by metabolic reactions. They also

              method for inferring cell lineages and pseudotimes from
              single-cell gene expression data. In previously published

  abstract = "A revolution in cellular measurement technology is under way: For
              the first time, we have the ability to monitor global gene
              regulation in thousands of individual cells in a single
              experiment. Such experiments will allow us to discover new cell
              types and states and trace their developmental origins. They
              overcome fundamental limitations inherent in measurements of bulk
              cell population that have frustrated efforts to resolve cellular
              states. Single-cell genomics and proteomics enable not only
              precise characterization of cell state, but also provide a
              stunningly high-resolution view of transitions between states.
              These measurements may finally make explicit the metaphor that
              C.H. Waddington posed nearly 60 years ago to explain cellular
              plasticity: Cells are residents of a vast ``landscape'' of
              possible states, over which they travel during development and in
              disease. Single-cell technology helps not only locate cells on
              this landscape, but illuminates the molecular mechanisms that
              shape the landscape itself. However, single-cell genomics is a
              field in its infancy, with many experimental and computational
              advances needed to fully realize its full potential.",

  title    = "Production of lentiviral vectors for transducing cells from the
              central nervous system",
  author   = "Li, Mingjie and Husic, Nada and Lin, Ying and Snider, B Joy",
  abstract = "Efficient gene delivery in the central nervous system (CNS) is
              important in studying gene functions, modeling neurological
              diseases and developing therapeutic approaches. Lentiviral
              vectors are attractive tools in transduction of neurons and other
              cell types in CNS as they transduce both dividing and
              non-dividing cells, support sustained expression of transgenes,
              and have relatively large packaging capacity and low toxicity.
              Lentiviral vectors have been successfully used in transducing
              many neural cell types in vitro and in animals. Great efforts
              have been made to develop lentiviral vectors with improved
              biosafety and efficiency for gene delivery. The current third
              generation replication-defective and self-inactivating (SIN)
              lentiviral vectors are depicted in Figure 1. The required
              elements for vector packaging are split into four plasmids. In
              the lentiviral transfer plasmid, the U3 region in the 5' long
              terminal repeat (LTR) is replaced with a strong promoter from
              another virus. This modification allows the transcription of the
              vector sequence independent of HIV-1 Tat protein that is normally
              required for HIV gene expression. The packaging signal ($\Psi$)
              is essential for encapsidation and the Rev-responsive element
              (RRE) is required for producing high titer vectors. The central
              polypurine tract (cPPT) is important for nuclear import of the
              vector DNA, a feature required for transducing non-dividing
              cells. In the 3' LTR, the cis-regulatory sequences are completely
              removed from the U3 region. This deletion is copied to 5' LTR
              after reverse transcription, resulting in transcriptional
              inactivation of both LTRs. Plasmid pMDLg/pRRE contains HIV-1
              gag/pol genes, which provide structural proteins and reverse
              transcriptase. pRSV-Rev encodes Rev which binds to the RRE for
              efficient RNA export from the nucleus. pCMV-G encodes the
              vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) that replaces
              HIV-1 Env. VSV-G expands the tropism of the vectors and allows
              concentration via ultracentrifugation. All the genes encoding the
              accessory proteins, including Vif, Vpr, Vpu, and Nef are excluded
              in the packaging system. The production and manipulation of
              lentiviral vectors should be carried out according to NIH
              guidelines for research involving recombinant DNA
              (http://oba.od.nih.gov/oba/rac/Guidelines/NIH\_Guidelines.pdf).
              An approval from individual Institutional Biological and Chemical
              Safety Committee may be required before using lentiviral vectors.
              Lentiviral vectors are commonly produced by cotransfection of
              293T cells with lentiviral transfer plasmid and the helper
              plasmids encoding the proteins required for vector packaging.
              Many lentiviral transfer plasmids and helper plasmids can be
              obtained from Addgene, a non-profit plasmid repository
              (http://www.addgene.org/). Some stable packaging cell lines have
              been developed, but these systems provide less flexibility and
              their packaging efficiency generally declines over time.
              Commercially available transfection kits may support high
              efficiency of transfection, but they can be very expensive for
              large scale vector preparations. Calcium phosphate precipitation
              methods provide highly efficient transfection of 293T cells and
              thus provide a reliable and cost effective approach for
              lentiviral vector production. In this protocol, we produce
              lentiviral vectors by cotransfection of 293T cells with four
              plasmids based on the calcium phosphate precipitation principle,
              followed by purification and concentration with
              ultracentrifugation through a 20\% sucrose cushion. The vector
              titers are determined by fluorescence- activated cell sorting
              (FACS) analysis or by real time qPCR. The production and
              titration of lentiviral vectors in this protocol can be finished
              with 9 days. We provide an example of transducing these vectors
              into murine neocortical cultures containing both neurons and
              astrocytes. We demonstrate that lentiviral vectors support high
              efficiency of transduction and cell type-specific gene expression
              in primary cultured cells from CNS.",

              manner2,3. This description reflects the inherently stochastic
              nature4,5,6,7,8,9 of gene expression, known to be a major factor
              in the heterogeneous response of individual cells within a clonal
              population to an inducing stimulus10,11,12,13,14,15,16. Here we
              show in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that stochasticity (noise)
              arising from transcription contributes significantly to the level
              of heterogeneity within a eukaryotic clonal population, in
              contrast to observations in prokaryotes15, and that such noise
              can be modulated at the translational level. We use a stochastic
              model of transcription initiation specific to eukaryotes to show
              that pulsatile mRNA production, through reinitiation, is crucial
              for the dependence of noise on transcriptional efficiency,
              highlighting a key difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic
              sources of noise. Furthermore, we explore the propagation of
              noise in a gene cascade network and demonstrate experimentally
              that increased noise in the transcription of a regulatory protein
              leads to increased cell--cell variability in the target gene
              output, resulting in prolonged bistable expression states. This
              result has implications for the role of noise in phenotypic
              variation and cellular differentiation.",

              Here, we report the advances of the consortium over the past two
              years. The new GO-CAM annotation framework was notably improved,
              and we formalized the model with a computational schema to check

              In addition, we describe the impacts of several collaborations to
              refine GO and report a 10\% increase in the number of GO
              annotations, a 25\% increase in annotated gene products, and over
              9,400 new scientific articles annotated. As the project matures,
